For me, this is not as important as it might be for some people, but check out this article over at The Ravyn.org showing you [how to never miss another TV show again][1].&nbsp;It uses BitTorrent and RSS feeds. You tell Azureus to scan an RSS feed with torrents in it, and when a particular torrent is found, download it and start it. So, take for example, i want to download every new episode of [Top Gear][2]&nbsp;when it comes out, i will tell azureus to download it, and once its live, i get it. i used this before and it works great. and with the extra bandwidth comming online eventually, it should make life a lot easer for me (my torrent downloading has been caped at the moment because of the upload speed and i dont want to use all my upload bandwidth on torrents.
