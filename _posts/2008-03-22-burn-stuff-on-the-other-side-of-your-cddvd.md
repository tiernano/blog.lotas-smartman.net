<a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,114592,tk,wb030804x,00.asp\">now thats handy</a>! PCWorld have an article talking about HP\&#8217;s new invention to allow you to burn labels on your CDs or DVDs. it looks look, and sounds like a cool idea. i remember reading about them DiscT@2 drives and wondering why someone wouldent work on it to burn the other side. that makes so much sense! i can never find my markers for writing on CDRs or DVDrs after they come out of the burner, and then they go missing, and 3 weeks later when i find them i havent a clue whats on them! i know i could just put it in the drive and find out that way, but im lazy. anyway, cool idea.
