Well, first thing first, [the site is pretty impresive!][1] for a microsoft.com site anyway. Interesting stuff. downloading at the moment. Something to do with photo sharing? The funny part is this [ZDNet article][2] saying you need a beefy machine: 1Gz with 256mb ram and and 200Mb hdd minimum, 2.4Gz PC with 512mb ram recomended. Wheres the beefy requirements? i havent seen a machine in a while that is not that spec!
