[JK On the run has one hell of a small desktop setup][1]. Using a [Sony U70][2] a bluetooth adapter and a bluetooth stow-away keyboard and a bluetooth mouse he managed to make a usable desktop computer weighing in at just 1.2 pounds! ohhh and dont forget the phone for Internet access when WIFI is not available! Now thats cool!
