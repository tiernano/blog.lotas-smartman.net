[Neowin.net &#8211; BT to do a Â£3bn upgrade on networks][1]. one of the things there doing is a full IP network so voice traffic will be converted into data at the home and then sent over the network. this will see cheaper calls for users im guessing. they are also trialing [fiber to the home][2] which will be cool if you can get it!
