Some info about the next XBox is [available here][1]. i like the fact that it is more then 1 Tera flop of power, and its a multicore chip. i want one as a workstation! not that theres anything wrong with a game machine with that much power, but for me i dont play games that often. i get bored quickly and want my Visual studio or internet explorer, or email or what ever back! i wonder if it will be hackable like the old one where they managet to get Linux and [Windows CE running on it][2]&#8230;. Running CE would be cool on it, but some how i think XP Embedded wont work since it needs an x86 processor, and the XBox 2 will have PPC (i think). Still it would be a fun project. **[update]** more info about it, including some spec info (like the fact that its currently got a 3 core 3Gz PowerPC processor, but the Alpha 2 models will come with 2 3Gz cores) is available [here at GeekNewsCentral][3]. sounds sweet!
