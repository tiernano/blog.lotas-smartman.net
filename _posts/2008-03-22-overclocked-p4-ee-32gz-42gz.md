[check out this page at Hexus.net][1]. they overclocked a P4 3.2Gz EE to 4.2GZ+! Sweet!

> Quote: *I wasn&#8217;t expecting much overclocking from the Extreme Edition, due to die size, but 4GHz was a genuine surprise, especially at the voltage needed. It&#8217;s a shame the voltage mod on the EPoX didn&#8217;t quite work, I&#8217;d have been showing off at 4.2GHz+.*

I want! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
