Ok. so, [Radio Userland][1] doesent like me any more for some reason. Not 100% sure why, but it died. now using [Movable Type][2] for the blog software, and also [AmphedaDesk][3] for the news aggregator. Very handy tools, and dont cost anything! Only one problem. Not as easy to post from the news aggregator to the blog. radio just had an option of click the news and post it to your own site. that was it! Ahhh well, ill have to get used to this!
