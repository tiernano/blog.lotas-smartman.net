Apple has released the [Mighty Mouse][1] and it has a mighty price. its $50 for a mouse! It has no buttons but there are sensors under the place where the left and right buttons should be. and theres a ball for scrolling around the place, insted of a wheel. theres squeeze buttons on the side too. its quite strange. Its also optical, which is now normal. I think it would be cheaper to buy a non apple mouse and use it.
