Right i got a better peice of software for showing photos on the web. Check out [this page][1] for the photos of the Aero 7+ and [this one for all pics][2] from my photos site. if you click a directory and then the little camera, it automaticly makes thumbnails! handy. its called [bad blue][3] and also acts as a web server. handy.
