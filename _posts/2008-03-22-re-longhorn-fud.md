Ok. ill let Scobe take it from here:n  


> [Martin Spedding][1]: Thanks Drew, it looks like I made the mistake of reading the Business Week article and assuming it was reporting news. It seems like another piece of FUD.
> 
> Like I said, the article only presents one piece of the story. The Longhorn story has 1000 pages. We&#8217;re only on page 25 of the Longhorn story (of Chapter one).
> 
> Take this as one piece of data, but by the time we&#8217;re done with the &#8220;road to Longhorn&#8221; book, this will be only one page out of 1000.
> 
> Some other things: will Longhorn be a freaking huge deal? Yes. Will it be the best OS? I&#8217;ll let you answer that one &#8211; see ya next year when we ship beta1. Will it be perfect? No. I guarantee there&#8217;ll be another OS after the Longhorn wave is a memory.
> 
> Will my credibility be intact at the end of the story (cause I hyped up Longhorn as &#8220;amazing&#8221;)? Yes.
