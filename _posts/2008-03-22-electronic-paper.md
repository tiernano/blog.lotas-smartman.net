Tree-Saving Electronic Paper Comes a Step Closer

By Patricia Reaney

LONDON (Reuters) &#8211; Electronic paper, which promises to change the face of publishing and save forests, came closer to reality on Wednesday as scientists revealed a super-thin, flexible electronic-ink display screen.

Just 0.012 inch thick, the device developed by researchers at E Ink Corporation in Cambridge, Massachusetts, can be flexed without distorting the type and paves the way for electronic newspapers, wearable computer screens and smart identity cards.

&#8220;It&#8217;s the closest thing demonstrated today to electronic paper,&#8221; Yu Chen, an electrical engineer at E Ink and a visiting scientist at Princeton University in New Jersey, told Reuters.

When it is fully developed e-paper will be able to display black and white and color text using wireless (news &#8211; web sites) technology.

Buying the daily newspaper will no longer be necessary because with e-paper it will be updated wirelessly or through the Internet.

&#8220;In the current form you can already receive images and read books through these displays screens,&#8221; Chen said but he added the display was still too slow for a video display because of the switching speed of the electronic ink.

The display consists of two components. The front part switches according to electronic signals and the back component is a circuit made of transistors that control each individual pixel that composes the display.

Each pixel needs a circuit, made of transistors, behind it to switch it. In order to make electronic paper the transistors have to be made on a very thin and flexible substrate.

&#8220;In our case it is a very thin stainless steel foil. You need to put a layer of electronic circuits on that foil,&#8221; Chen said.

Chen, who reported the research in the science journal Nature, said the size can vary from a business card to a computer screen. The current device is too thick to be folded in half but Chen and his team are working on a thinner a version.

&#8220;Our work demonstrated that you can make high-quality electronic circuits on very thin and flexible substrates,&#8221; he added.
