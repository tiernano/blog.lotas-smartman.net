So, while reading the blogs this morning, I found [a post over at Micheal Fox’s Weblog][1]. He is a pro photographer, who’s blog I subscribed a while back. In the post he talks about prepping for a big event, in this case E3. Interesting read, some cool stuff and cool tips too. Interesting to think that he carries around 3 camera, and a total of 32Gb of memory! Interesting read.
