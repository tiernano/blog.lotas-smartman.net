[this blog post has some photos][1] of the banners apple has up around the WWDC confrence. stuff like &#8220;introducing Longhorn&#8221; or &#8220;redmond, start your photocopiers&#8221; and &#8220;this should keep redmond busy&#8221;. Still no word on weather it will be broadcast on the web or not. its not being broadcase via satelite or in apple stores. hopefully there will be a live case.
