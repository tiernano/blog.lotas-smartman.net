AppleInsider is talking about Apple and [Quad core, Dual proc (8 core) Mac Pros][1]. these are rumors at the moment, but would be easily posible. I <a HREF="/archive/2006/09/14/14011.aspx">posted</a> a link to a Anandtech article (direct link to [article here][2]) where they stuck 2 of these Quad core chips (engineering samples) into a mac pro and it worked. Next question though: Will the non engineering sample version of the Quad Core Xeon work on a Mac Pro? Next question after that, where do i get a new Xeon board for my 2 old (well, not that old) Xeons that would be taken out of the Mac Pro and used else where? <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
