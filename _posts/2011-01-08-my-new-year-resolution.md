And no, i don&#8217;t mean 1920*1080… <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/wlEmoticon-smile.png" />

here are a list of some of the things i would like to get done this year…

  * **Develop at least one mobile app** and release it to a store of some sort or all 3 (iTunes, Windows Phone 7 and Android) this way i am attacking all 3 platforms…
  * **Work on my own projects outside of work: **I have a few ideas, just need to sit down and work on them&#8230; similar to above, but most of the ideas are “services”… the apps above would probably talk to said services…
  * **Move the sites outside of the network**: Leave my home broadband for my personal use and host my sites in a proper datacentre, or even the cloud&#8230; only host test sites in house.
  * **Use a language other than c# for programming**: So, i can use C# to develop for Windows Phone 7, and with the help of Mono i can write for iPhone/iPad and Android also. But i also want to write in another language other than what i have used before. So, thats Java, C#, C/C++ out of the picture… F#? Ruby? Assembly? something new and different… Objective C even…
  * **Take more photos: **My camera usually sits in it&#8217;s bag beside the desk and only comes out to play on occasion. I would like to get out more and take more photos. even if they are not top quality photos, just photos. the more i take, the more i learn.
  * **Finally fix my room and desk once and for all!** This place has become a nightmare to get around&#8230; There are machines I can see but physically can&#8217;t get to&#8230; Others have been on for years, but never upgraded&#8230;. I have a box in here still running win2k3! So, clear the room, rewire for proper network (cat6 and GigE) and try and get it as a nice place to work, sleep and watch movies&#8230;

So, they are my resolutions. I Did something kind of [similar last year][1], and in the next few days i should probably go back and see how i got on… but they are my commitments for this year. We see how i get on… And more in the sprit of last years post, here are some random things i would like to do this year.

  * **Get a new media centre box**: need something that can record a lot of TV shows and move encoded video to the SAN&#8230; this should have a couple of satellite tuners (my current one has 2, ideally 4 would be better), BluRay drive (have one spare here), HDMI out with Audio (currently need to convert from DVI->HDMI and use optical or analogue sound out…) and enough horse power to re-code DVDs and BluRays quickly…
  * **Build a SAN:** Have the hardware, or at least most of it. Now to get it working&#8230; Thinking Open Solaris as the OS with ZFS as the file System. have a Dell Poweredge 2950 here with 8 hot swap hard drive bays and some other internal drives… i am planning on using this and an External SAS enclosure with a 8 port External SAS card to bring the drive count to 16. this **\*should\*** be enough for a while… 
  * **Rip ALL my DVDs and BluRays** to MP4 and store them on the SAN so anything can stream them: XBox360, PS3 and AppleTV, as well as the Media Centre running Boxee&#8230; even if they get ripped as ISOs or folders, i have enough horse power in the house to convert these to pretty much anything… should be all good!

Any comments, suggestions of the language i should pick, questions? leave comments!
