Ok. i was looking for a microphone, but still no luck. i did see a cool looking bluetooth headset, but it was about 60eur and there is a good chance it wont work with my phone, and knowning me, the podcasting will stop after a while for me. but you never know. anyway, thats on my &#8220;might get&#8221; list. so, i did see some interesting head phones, but i have been very busy over the last while and havent gotten out to get it yet. i will eventually. it might be this week, it might be next week. i am just waiting though for someone to release an app that records whats being played though your pocket PC and records whats comming in though the microphone too. that could mean in theory that i could create a podcast on the go and upload when i get home. that i wouldent mind trying. some might think im weird on the bus though&#8230;
