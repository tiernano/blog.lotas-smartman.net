[neowin are reporting][1] that the Music industry think that 99c per song is not enough and want $1.25 &#8211; $2.99! Bastards are never satisfied! firstly, they want money for music people download, which i can understand about (to an extent because some music you should be paid for having to listening to!) . but now they want more. no wonder there loosing more and more money a year. thats my rant for the day.
