someone over at Programming ADO.NET has run some [benchmarks to see how MySQL, MSSQL 2005 Express and PostgreSQL all fair agenst each other][1]. The results are interesting. one thing though. they give results as a number (2.0 means 2x as fast as the slowest) but ideally, the time taken and the number of requests per second would have been better. Still, pretty cool!
