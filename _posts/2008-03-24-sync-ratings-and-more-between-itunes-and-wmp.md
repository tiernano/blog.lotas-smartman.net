One of the problems i have at the moment is i have my play lists seperated over 2 different players: iTunes because of the iPod, and Windows Media Player for the Media Center and XBox 360. Well, Check out this <a class href="http://thegreenbutton.com/forums/thread/34552.aspx">app over at The Green Button</a>. Its called MusicBridge and It will allow you to sync the content between both players, including play counts and ratings. Very cool stuff!
