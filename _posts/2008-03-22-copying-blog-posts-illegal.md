[Russell beatie is saying that copying his Blog posts is illegal][1] after [scoble][2] was [talking about it yesterday][3]. i have done some reblogging, but this was only because i dident realize it was illegal! so, to those who i reblogged, sorry. if you want a post removed, tell me. ill sort it out. most of the time though i read the article, create a link and then talk about it. thats ok, right?
