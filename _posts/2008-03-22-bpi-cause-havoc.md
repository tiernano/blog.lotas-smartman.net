Some stupid bastard in the BPI has decided that [CDWOW][1] shouldnet be able to sell cds at a resonable price, and told them to up the price by Â£2 or EUR3. but, all you have to do is buy from the web site in hong kong ([which i have a link to here][2]) and but it that way. shipping is free world wide, and go to [XE][3] for currancy conversion. the slashdot article is [here][4]. you save more in the long run!
