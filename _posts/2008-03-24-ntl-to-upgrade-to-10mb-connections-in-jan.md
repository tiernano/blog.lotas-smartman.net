I have heard a bit about this before, but [this Boards.ie thread][1] about it is making me think its actually happening. i need to get my modem upgraded first, which will hopefully happen soon, and then, 10mb here i come! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> this will give a bit of a speed boost to the site too, because of the 512k upload, up from 300k, but the 10mb down is just sweet!
