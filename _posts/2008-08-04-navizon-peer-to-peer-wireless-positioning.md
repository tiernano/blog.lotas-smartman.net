So, a couple of months back, I started playing with Navizon on my iPhone. The reason was simple: they had better coverage than the guys running the AGPS for the iPhone, and, not only that, you could get paid for mapping data. The idea is quite simple: if you have a device with a GPS reciever, Wifi or a phone (or both) you run a piece of software on that device and it maps Wifi and Cell tower locations. Now, this is where it gets interesting. For every Wifi AP you discover, you get 3 points. For every Cell tower, you get 15. If its anrealy existing Wifi point you get 1 and an already existing Cell tower you get 2. For every 10,000 points, you get $15. Might not sound like a lot, but on Saturday i drove to Galway with both my N95 and TyTn II mapping the way with Navizon, and i stacked up quite a lot of points! Given i have both devices with me every day anyway, i might as well just run the app and make a bit of money <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

But, what if you dont have a GPS on your phone? How does it work then? Well, Magic, kind of. since Wifi points and Cell tower locations are known to Navizon (in a given coverage area) you can find your way with the software. its quite accurate too. there is both a Free Version and a Premium version. i have played with both and they are quite handy. mind you, havent used them too much for Navigation, due to, well, having GPS in 2 other devices&#8230;

So, if your interested and want to play around, check them out [here][1]. in the sprit of Full Disclosure, this is a referal link. I get free points based on the points you make from the program.
