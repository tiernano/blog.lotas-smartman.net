[this blog post shows you how to get WordPress working on IIS][1]. and [this one shows you how to get the permalinks looking cool under IIS too][2]. Also, check out [ISAPI_Rewrite][3]. Its a little addon for IIS which comes in 2 versions, a lite one, which is free and a non lite one which is not free. the lite one looks good. since i will be testing on Windows XP Pro, i dont need virtual servers, since they are not supported. i will start playing with this soon. i know i was to move the server inhouse last weekend, but i dident get a chance. this weekend i could get it moved, but i dont know yet. IIS on XP Pro might not be able to handle the connections i get since its limited to 10 connections at a time. but i will start playing around and see what happens. interesting read and handy articles. Found though [Wordlog][4].
