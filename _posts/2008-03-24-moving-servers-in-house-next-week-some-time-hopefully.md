Ok. once i get my KVM switch, im moving my sites back in to my network. well, most of them anyway. i have to use my hosting site for something. i paid enough for it. so, hopefully the KVM switch will arive next week. that should be cool. Also, a quite note. From Thursday 12th @ 5pm to Tuesday 24th @ about 8am I am on holidays. i will have my phone and palmtop with me, but blogging from them is hard. WordPress doesent like blogging from phones. or at least i havent figured it out yet. i might try it later. anyway, there might be a lack of posts for them days.
