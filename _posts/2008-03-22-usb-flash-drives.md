[Tom&#8217;s Hardware Guide Mass Storage: Hop To It: Kanguru Micro Drive With USB 2.0 &#8211; Small Or Quick: Take Your Pick][1]. Hmmmm. i like the 1gb one! Only thing if i got it is i have no USB2 ports, so 12mb/s would be max. great thing is i can use it pretty much anywhere. i was thinking of getting one of these. maybe a 64 &#8211; 128mb model. Anyway, good read!
