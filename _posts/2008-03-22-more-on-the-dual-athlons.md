Ok. [this article over at hardware zone][1] has some info about running standard athlon XP cpus as MP chips. its an interesting idea. It would save me about 180 quid (MP is 191 for a singne chip, the XP, both 2400+/2Gz each, is 81 quid.) actually it would save me nearly 220 quid. thats the price of the board nearly. thats also the price of 1 and a half of the hard drives. man i think ill try this!!!
