A long, long time ago

I can still remember

How that blogging used to make me smile

And I knew if I had my chance

I could make the Googledance

And maybe Technorati for a while

September always made me shiver

My aggregator would deliver

Bad news in my newsfeed

I couldn&#8217;t take one more read

I can&#8217;t remember if I cried

When I read about his pregnant bride

But something touched me deep inside

The day the blogging died

And they were singing

Bye bye wiki atom necho pie

Took my standard to a body

But the body had died

And the good ol&#8217; boys

Drinking kool-aid and lies

Singing this was the day blogging died
