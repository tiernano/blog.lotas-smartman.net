[Slashdot | Apple Terminates Safari Seed Program][1]. Can you blame them? I know if you are a developer, and you want other developers to see what they think of the software, and they start to release it to the web, like whats happening to MS and the [MSDN][2] with some of their MSDN users releasing the CD Images of the beta software onto the net, you would be quite angry. well in one way. the other way, it meens more users get their hands on the beta code and see what its like, test it, and send in more bug reports. Its up to apple though. I know i would probably prefear more bug reports from more users then just from developers. [Osnews][3] also has [this][4].
