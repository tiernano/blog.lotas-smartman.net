Looks like [the record industry are being b\*****ds again][1]. They want apple to up the price of their downloads, share profits from the iPods, or they will cut them off. Simple solution to the problem: dont buy their music. Use places like [the podsafe music network][2] or even [AllOfMP3.com][3] (which i still dont know the legal issue with). Tell they RIAA they have an option: 99c per song, no iPod revenu, etc, or we buy the music from the Russian&#8217;s AllOfMP3.com and they get even less! Simple. [update] ok, when i have done some censoring of this post, but not a lot, because the first time i read the slashdot article i got really angry, and it was more of a rant then anything else.
