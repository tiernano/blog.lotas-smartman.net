Check out the [Creative Zen Vision][1]: a 30Gb Portable media player (not sure if its a Microsoft Portable Media Center, though it does have [Plays For Sure][2] status). It plays video&nbsp;on a&nbsp;640&#215;480 3.7&#8243; display, and looks quite cool. It has compact flash support (with optional adapter for reading MMC, SD and Smart Media. Looks quite cool. and at $399, its got the right price! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
