[Windows 95 makes it to Pocket PC][1]. This is just weird. I wonder can you get access to the network using this? Interesting to hear though. full internet access on your pocket PC. now all i need is a pocket PC! [update] [Playstation 1 emaulator for the pocket pc too!][2] man these things are fast. id say the [Axim x30][3] would be sweet for these. 600+Mhz Processor and all that.
