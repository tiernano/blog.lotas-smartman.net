[Bruce Cowper has links to 3 windows firewall log parsers][1]. very handy. now if i could get a firewall parser for my Linksys WRT54G i would be happy. there probably is one, but i havent found it yet. [update] i just found [WallWatcher][2] which looks pretty cool and supports the WRT54G, but i need the [Sveasoft][3] firmware for it. now to get my hands on that. looks good.
