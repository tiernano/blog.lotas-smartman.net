> *IBM touts the ability to run i5/OS, Windows, Linux and AIX on the same server. Using IBM&#8217;s latest partitioning technology, customers can also run up 10 partitions per processor. In total, this makes it possible to run a number of applications on a single system, reducing overall hardware costs.*</p>
