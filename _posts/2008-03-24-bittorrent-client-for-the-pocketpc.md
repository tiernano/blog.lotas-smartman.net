Ok, when i first heard about a [BitTorrent client for the PocketPC][1] (which was about 2 min ago) i though &#8220;Why?!&#8221;. After a little time though, this actually does make sense. very handy for podcast downloading, etc. Speaking of podcast downloading, i will have one some time this week, hopefully if all goes well. Also, i hope to have a new, faster internet connection (faster in an upload sense (2mb up from 300k) but slightly slower in a download sense (2mb down from 3mb)) in the next few weeks. i will be ordering on monday or tuesday of next week. I hope to have as little downtime as posible. there may be some though because of DNS records being remapped, etc. Now, what to do with my 3mb cable from NTL&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
