Well, not just any camera phones, but my Smartphone 2 and my XDA2s both dont write EXIF data to the JPGs they take, which is a pain in the ass. I think (not totally sure though) that my Nokia 7650 used to write EXIF data when taking photos. At the moment, its not a major problem, but if the camera app could write EXIF data, then it could do other interesting things, like write GPS data if its connected to a GPS device. Does anyone know of a way to get an XDA2s or iMate Smartphone 2 to write EXIF data? prefably the XDA, since im using it a bit more now&#8230;
