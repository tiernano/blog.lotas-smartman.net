[slashdot are reporting that hotmail and yahoo are blocking gmail invites][1] or at least putting them in the junk folder, and hotmail are doing this to gmail normal email too. i actually noticled some email i would sent to my self from my gmail account to my hotmail account ending up in the junk bin. wonder is this accidental? you wouldent know. [gmail are scanning email servers for some reason][2]. maybe hotmail and the rest are worried about this? hmmmm. dont know.
