[This slashdot article][1] talks about [Dynebolic][2], a linux distro on a CD. this doesent sound very cool, but [this ZDNet][3] article talks about it being able to do automatic clustering of systems, and not only that, it runs on an XBox! haha. cool. cluster of XBoxen. thats not bad cause the xbox, being a 733Mhz P3 with some amount of ram and 8gb hdd (probably wrong there) is quite cheap @ about 200 euro. a nice cluster of these would be cool.
