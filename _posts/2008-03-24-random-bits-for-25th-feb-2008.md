Three Ireland are to launch a Mobile Broadband package which requires no contract. In other words, [Prepaid Mobile Broadband][1]. 1 day, 500mb costs 5EUR, 1 week, 2Gb package cost 10EUR and a month 10Gb cost 25EUR. 49c per MB after that. interesting idea&#8230; Wonder if Bit Torrent is allowed? You could buy a couple of these, leave them seeding a podcast or video cast or something, and cheap (ish) fast (ish, 3.6mb/s down and 384k up) bandwidth&#8230; and its mobile!

[6 core Xeon&#8217;s on the way?][4] SWEET!
