check out this second article from the Lazy Admin (the first was [enabling BITS caching][1], which i linked to here) showing you [how to enable HTTP compression][2], both incomming and outgoing (your clients, from your network, request external sites to be compressed and sent to them, and, users from outside your network can request your site, compressed, to them. handy!) on ISA 2004 SP2
