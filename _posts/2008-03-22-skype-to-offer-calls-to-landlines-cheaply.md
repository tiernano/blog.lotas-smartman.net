[the register has found that Skype][1] will soon allow voip calls to landlines world wide soon. prices for 25 countries, including ireland, are 1.2eurocents but EU customers have to pay VAT on top of that. this is pretty cool to tell you the truth. the one thing i would like to see though is allowing landlines to ring skype users. that would be sweet. you would probably have an access point in each country or area, and pay a fee to use the access point (could be free though, if we are lucky) and users who want to ring you ring the access point, put in your customer number, and your computer rings. that would definatly be nice <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
