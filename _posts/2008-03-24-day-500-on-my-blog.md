Wahoo! I have just reached day 500 on my blog! OK. not great, but cool enough. there has been over 10000 visitors in the last while since i added the new counter at the side. Well i first mentioned the new counter on [June 17][1]. Im going to guess it was about June 15th since i added it so its roughly 50 days or so. which works out at an average of about 215 visitors a day. thats unique visitors too. So, heres to the next 500 Days!
