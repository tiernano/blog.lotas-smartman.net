So, a few days back i mentioned that my Mac Pro died… this meant that i could start the process of planning and building the Workstation V.Next, as i like to call it.

So, what do i currently have planned:

  * The Board: [Intel Shady Cove S5520S][1]. It has 
      * 12 DIMM sockets, each supporting up to 4Gb, giving a total of 48Gb RAM
      * 2 1366 Sockets, allowing 2 Xeon 5500 Series processors
      * 6 SATA ports
      * 8 USB Ports (including the extra headers)
      * 2 Firewire ports
      * 2 PCI Express x16 V2 slots
      * 4X, 8X PCI Express and a PCI slot
      * Non SLI Compatible, but Crossfire is good to go…
      * and twin GigE Network ports
      * ![chipset][2]
  * CPU: [Intel Xeon E5520][3] X2 
      * Intel-VT
      * x64
      * 2.26Gz
      * 8mb cache
      * Hyper-Threading
      * Quad Core
      * 731 Million Transistors!
      * ![Xeon inside][4]
  * Case: [SilverStone TJ07][5]
  * Cooling: Water

At the moment, i am not 100% sure what to get when it comes to water cooling gear. all i know is that i could potentially fit a 4x120mm rad in the bottom of the case and stick a pump and reservoir in one or 2 of the 5.25
