Right. listening to the radio over the internet here in fas at the moment ([FM 104][1] if you have to know!) and they have a thing called office olympics. so, i had to either take a photo, scan or photo copy 2 of the following: a mouse, staples, a mobile phone and a lunch item. then send it to them either by fax or email. so i emailed them [this photo of my mouse and stapes!][2] anyway, someone also emailed in this thing thats quite weird. with your right foot, life it up a bit and rotate it clockwise. while doing this, using your right hand make a &#8220;6&#8221; in the air. your foot changes direction. i tried this and it works. i also said to the guy beside me to try it and he did. it worked. funny. anyway, wish me luck with the olympics! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
