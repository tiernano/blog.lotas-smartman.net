Jonathan Swift has a post showing you how to call an [unmanaged DLL from C#.][1] this is a handy feature. if only i knew C#! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> I can see this being used for image processing, image resizing, or anything mathamatically chalanging as C++ is faster, or at least gives the impression of being faster. am i wrong there?
