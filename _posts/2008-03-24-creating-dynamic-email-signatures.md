Very interesting article over at [Coding4Fun on MSDN about creating Dynamic email signatures][1]. The idea is you create a website that generates an image based on content from an RSS Feed, and embeds it into your images. you can have settings setup so that the image is either sent in the email, or stays on a server and is downloaded when ever. the second one has problems with security, but the first sounds good.   
bk_keywords: email, asp.net, rss
