I have gone a bit mad in the January sales and today i bought a new Laptop (HP Pavillion DV8025EA with an AMD Turion 64 processor 1.8Gz, 1Gb ram, 80b hdd and a very sweet 17&#8243; Wide screen! Extreamly cool!) and i also bought a 60Gb iPod with video. very nice screen. i am using it as my main podcasting and videocasting device. anyway, photos and more later. now to get x64 version of windows running properly on it&#8230;
