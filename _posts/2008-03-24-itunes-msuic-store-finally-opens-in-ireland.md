well after nearly 3 months wait (it was ment to launch in October) [the Irish iTunes music store has launced][1]. Only thing is nothing, other then my laptop and workstation and imac, will play music from this. like i cant play it on my PPC or Smartphone. in theory there is a cheat though. burn it to CD, re rip it in Windows media player with no DRM and then send it to the PPC or smartphone. i might try this out&#8230;.
