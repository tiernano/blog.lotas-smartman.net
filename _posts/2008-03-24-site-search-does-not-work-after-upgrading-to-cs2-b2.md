[Community Server 2 BETA 3 is out][1], but untill i decide to install that (probably the weekend), here is a tip for you all. when i upgraded to B2, search did not work on older posts. this was due to an indexing issue. Check out [this post][2] on the CS forums about how to solve this problem. I have just enabled it, so search should be fully up and running by this time tomorrow&#8230; Hopefully.
