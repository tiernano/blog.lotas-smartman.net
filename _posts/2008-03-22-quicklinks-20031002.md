[Music industry blames net for falling sales][4] This is after wired [clamed that file sharing is down 41%][5]. and [HardOCP][6] said this last night   
*O.K., so music sharing has dropped off 41%&#8230;and according to the RIAA, file sharing is THE reason for the lost revenue in the music industry&#8230;right? Well, show me the money!! You heard me&#8230;show me the money. This is the golden opportunity for the RIAA to prove they were right when they said file sharing was causing the massive revenue loss and not overpriced CDs and huge sums of money wasted by the music industry. The RIAA will have to change its tune when file sharing continues to decline but so do their revenues&#8230;don&rsquo;t you think?*
