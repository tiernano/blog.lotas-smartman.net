[The Register][1] [is reporting on the XBOX 2 Sepcs][2], which has been leaked to the web. it will have 3 Power 5 processors, which will be Hyperthreading enabled, and an ATI R500 Graphics Card. Not only is the chips running as hyper threading (2 threads at once, a la P4 and Xeon), there will be 2 cores per chip. so it will (in theory) act as a 12 processor system. now i would like to see that running other stuff other then games. it will support DirectX10, and will have the Graphics API from Longhorn. interesting.
