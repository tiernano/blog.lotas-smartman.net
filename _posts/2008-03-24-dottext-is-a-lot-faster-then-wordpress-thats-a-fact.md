I have noticed that dotTEXT is a lot faster to load then wordpress was. when i opened the browser window with wordpress, it would be a blank white screen for a few seconds, then change t the title of the site, and then, finally after an other few seconds, everything would show up. this might be something to do with the speed of the server, but i dont know. with dotTEXT, now everything loads pretty instantly! SWEET.
