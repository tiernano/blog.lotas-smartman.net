I was just playing with the apple store to see how much the ultimate mac would cost. So to start, you get your self the Power Mac G5 with twin 2.5Gz G5 Processors and 8Gb ram, 2 250Gb hdds, the new NVIDIA GeForce 6800 Ultra DDL thats needed to run the displays cause your also getting 2 30&#8243; [displays][1] apple just released yesterday. a 40Gb ipod, and pretty much everything else you can trow at it, including macosx10.3 server, and the total cost for the ultimate mac is just over the 18 grand mark! 18,000 dollers! i know cars cheaper then that! but then again, they dont come with 8gb ram, 500gb hdd space, 2 2.5gz processors and 2 massive 30&#8243; displays. \*drool\*
