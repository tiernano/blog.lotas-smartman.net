[this is madness][1]. get your computer to pretend its a monkey, or in my case, 559 monkeys, and let it see how long it takes to make shakespear. my mahcine has worked for just over 371 monkey years. lots of pages written (1.37e+7!) and nealry 2 million bananas eaten. this is just funny! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
