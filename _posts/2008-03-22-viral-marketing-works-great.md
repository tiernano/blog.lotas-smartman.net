the amount of people linking back to me now or talking about me because of the[ little stunt i pulled yesterday offering Gmail accounts][1]. just check [feedster for results on Tiernan][2]. over 1000 instants of me! wahoo! there are still people talking about it today. [Chris Szugort is talking about it][3] (well, about gmail invites being Viral Marketing, which i agree with!). this is pretty funny. i got an extra 200 visitors to my main weblog yesterday because of it. lots of people read the [weblogs.asp.net article i posted][1] because of the lure of free invites! Im going to have to try this again when i get more invites. the invites i got yesterday where my 3 set of invites (i got 3 first, then a bunch of 6, and then yesterday i got an other 6). So, i have none today, but maybe tomorrow. thats an other viral marketing thing. come back tomorrow and continue reading my blog for more info! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> dont forget to subscribe to my [RSS feed][4]! direct to your desktop! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> use any of the many RSS Readers out there ([RSS Bandit][5], [Sharp Reader][6], or any of the others you find when [searching google][7]).
