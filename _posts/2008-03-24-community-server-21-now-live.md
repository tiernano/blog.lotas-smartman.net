Looks like [Community Server 2.1 has been released][1]. Very cool. this site for those of you who dont know, is run on CS2.0. So i will be doing an upgrade over the next day or so. best feature i have seen so far? the [FeedBurner][2] support in the box! Wahoo! ![][3]&nbsp;and the Tagging stuff will be handy too&hellip;
