Ok. since im using [blog lines][1] as my main RSS reader of choice at the moment, you can check out [my blog lines blog here][2]. there is a list of all the blogs im currently subscribed to, half of which are only there because i &#8220;borrowed&#8221; the OPML list from [Josh Bancroft over at TinyScreenFulls][3]. mind you, the list is now at 667 feeds, and im adding more all the time. anyway, if i read interesting news and im too lazy to post it here, which happens because of work/lack of sleep/lack of caffeene, then it will be posted over there! Its kind of like [Scobles Link blog][4].
