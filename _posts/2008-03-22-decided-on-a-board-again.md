Ok. i have decided the [MSI K7D][1] board is the one i want. its 246.49, a bit cheaper then the last one. its a total of 38.35 down from the old setup. I have all the prices in an Excell XP Spreadsheet. updated 4 times and includes a little graph. its here if you want it (<a href="http://www.lotas-smartman.net/blog/archives/prices.xls" target="_blank">prices.xls</a>).
