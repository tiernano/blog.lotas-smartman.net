I was listening to Scott Hanselman&#8217;s podcast on [Being a Better developer in 6 months][1], and it started to make me think: I want to be a better developer! So, some things I want to teach my self over the next few months:

**More Ajax**: I have done a fair amount with Ajax over the last while, but there is a lot more to do. So, I want to play more with Ajax, and learn more. 

**Silverlight**: This is a very cool technology, and I want to learn how to use it. 

**WCF**: Windows Communications Foundation is one of those technologies that I still cant figure out why I HAVENT used it yet! Strange, but true!

**WPF**: sound be in with the Silverlight &#8220;commitment&#8221;. 

**Ruby-on-Rails**: this is my non Microsoft&nbsp;technology&nbsp;related project. I defiantly like the look of this, and have seen a lot of cool things around this, but never started coding in it. 

So, we check back every 4th Friday of the month for the next 6 months (I have the reoccurring meeting in my calendar, which, due to other commitments may move around) and see how I am doing. </p>
