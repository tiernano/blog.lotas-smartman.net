BetaNews.com is reporting that AMD has [released new Opteron processors][1]. named the Next-Generation Opteron, these run at 2.6Gz for their dual core processors, and have a new socket design, named Socket F. the Quad core processors, which will be out Mid 2007 will be socket, electrical and thermal compatible with the current Next Gen Opterons, so you can just take your current (well, the new ones) CPU out and stick in the new Quad core chips. makes me wonder how much faster they are to the new Xeons out now (if at all) and what this Socket F gives over the old socket&#8230;. (faster ram maybe?)
