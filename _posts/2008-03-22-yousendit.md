<a href=\"http://www.yousendit.com/\">YouSendIt</a> is a pretty coo service for anyone who needs to send large files to someone else and they only have small email boxes. you upload the site to the site, it then stores it on the sevrer for 7 days and then emails a link to the person you want to send the file to. files up to 1gb in size are supported. i found the link <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/32046\">on meta filter</a>. Interesting idea. now to email friends stupid files&#8230;.
