Right. due to a problem with my isp about their terms of service, i will be moving my site to the US pretty soon. i hope to have the order for it in tomorrow, and start transfering stuff over by tomorrow night. i hope to have as little downtime as posible and the whole thing up and running before firday. on firday im going to Sligo for a few days for the bank holiday weekend here. so i wont be here for the weekend. ill keep you informed. i know there will be a DNS change soon, but im hoping it wont take too long. im moving my servers to [JVDS][1]. they look pretty cool. i get a fully dedicated virtual machine, with root access and all. sweet. anyway, wish me luck!
