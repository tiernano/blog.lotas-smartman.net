I have just decided to use [mozilla][1] for pretty much everything. i havent reinstalled windows yet, and normal hyperlinks in outlook aint working. also outlook express doesent have filters, that i know of, and also outlook 2000+ wont install. so mozilla is doing a good job. it checks my mail, filters it and also has spam controls! wahoo! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> and when i click a link, it open in mozilla too. what more could you want?!
