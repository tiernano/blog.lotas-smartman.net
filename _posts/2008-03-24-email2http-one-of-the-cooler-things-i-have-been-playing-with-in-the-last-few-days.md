So, I have been playing with [Email2HTTP][1] for the last few hours, and, well, I am very impressed! It is very cool, and to prove how easy it actually is to use, after writing code for about 20 min, this is being posted with the help of Email2HTTP. The way it works is simple: you sign up on the Email2HTTP website for an account, and they give you a testing domain name. you then go to their site, setup a HTTP redirect (where the email contents gets posted to) and then write the code that takes the email to be processed. you can setup different methods to limit what email gets though either on their end or on your server end. Now the code I have written takes the subject and body of the email and posts it to the blog, then returns an email to myself with the response. hopefully this works! Anyway, if your reading this, it should have worked! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
