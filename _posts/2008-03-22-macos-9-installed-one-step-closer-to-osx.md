Right. just got Mac OS 9.0.4 installed from the iMac software CDRom. this was done with the help of [Basilisk II][1] running MacOS 7.5.3, a linux box (my workstation) and some cat5 cable! the mac seen the BasiliskII Emulated mac and then seen the CDROM. i copied the contents of the cdrom to the mac&#8217;s desktop and installed it from there. all worked well. so, im going to get my copy of OSX soon (not sure when) and try a simular install method. should work, hopefully!
