Today i have been playing with both [Mini and Net Stumbler][1], a peice of software called [KML-WarDrive][2] and a copy of [Google Earth][3]. I brought my Dell Axim x30, mini stumbler and my bluetooth GPS with me for a quick drive, and got ministumbler to record the whole trip. when i got home, i imported the file created by ministumbler, exported it as a summary file, and opened the KML-WarDrive app, which tooks the summary file and generated a Google Earth file for me to use. Very cool stuff! Also, in a tip of just under 15 Miles round trip, i came accross 72 Access points, of which, 25 where open, 49 where closed, and 7 had their default SSID. I also came accross 3 [Irish Wan][4] Access Points, which is nice to see.
