Right. i finally got my mac up and running properly and its working quite fast, i think. i got a new 80gb hdd for the mac, a 7200RPM Hitachi, and i had problems with it on saturday. i set it as master, which is what they want you to do, but OSX told me it couldent be installed on to the drive as it was not bootable. i then set the drive on Cable Select, and OSX installed, but the drive still wouldent boot! so, after 3 days of trying to figure out what the hell was wrong, i opened the machine and set the drive as master, and heay presto! it worked! it actually booted off the drive, not the CD. so it installed disc 2 and then i installed my copy of xcode. and, after some googling, i found [this article][1] on how to move your home directory to a different partition! SWEET! since my main boot partition is 6gb, and 3.3 is taken up by the OS, the second partition is perfect for other stuff. so, that works well!
