[This guy decided to tidy up his home lan][1] since it was quite untidy. Well, it got me thinking. if he needs to tidy it up with only a router, modem, switch, and some other things (only 3 power supplies, so theres something weird there) i definatly need some tidy up with my router/switch/modem/2 macs, 2 servers, workstation, laptop, lots of cables, etc&#8230; maybe saturday, and i will get photos. now to build some interesting things&#8230;.
