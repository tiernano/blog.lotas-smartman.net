[check out this engadget article][1] about Hitachi&#8217;s 500Gb desktop hard drive and their 10 (and 8 ) gb micro drives. these are the same drives used in the ipod mini, so you do the maths! not only that, but eventually you should be able to get them for CF Cards, or they are already CF cards, which would be cool for a PDA or camera. [**Update**] Fixed the link. sorry about that!
