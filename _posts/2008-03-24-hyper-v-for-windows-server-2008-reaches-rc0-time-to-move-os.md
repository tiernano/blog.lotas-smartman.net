So, Hyper-V, the virtualization technology for Windows 2008, has [reached RC0][1]. John Howard has a post [detailing the steps required to install][2] this on a machine. there has also been talk about how good [Windows 2008 Server will be as a Workstation][3] and it has started me thinking: Is it time to upgrade the MacPro to run Win2k8 server instead of Windows Vista? What will work as planed and what will fail to work? Can I share my music and movies to my XBox 360 still? These are all questions that will have to be answered. I will be playing around with Virtual PC and a copy of 2k8 server Virtualized and see if I can get it to do what I want it to do. If I can get it to share my films to the 360 and one or 2 other pieces, I will be ordering more RAM for the machine (currently got 5Gb, which should be enough, but you can never have too much ram!) and start the migration process&#8230;. [Stay Tuned][4]!
