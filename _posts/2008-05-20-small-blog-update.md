so, yesterday i mentioned that the [blog is being powered by a CDN][1] for all the Javascript, CSS and images. this, from what i can see, has hepled speed up the site. This will tide me over till my [Dedicated Server][2] arrives, when ever that will be&#8230;. <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> anyway, i have updated the front page. to show full posts, not just the Excerpts. If anyone has any complaints, please leave a comment&#8230;
