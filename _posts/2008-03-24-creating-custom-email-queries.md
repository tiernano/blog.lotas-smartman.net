[ONLamp.com: Creating Custom Email Queries][1]. Very interesting article. the ability to have all your mail in a SQL db and to be able to search for stuff quickly is cool. there are other options out there though. [lookout][2] is one that you add into Outlook and then there is [Zoe][3] which is a stand alone kind of system. Still, the oreilly net article is good.
