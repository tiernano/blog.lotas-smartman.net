[EWeek is reporting][1] that Microsoft&#8217;s [Virtual PC][2] will run linux, but wont be supported. this i am not suprised at and knew. MS released a beta of 2004 and some people where playing with it and it still ran linux. its not a selectable option, but it runs. Also, hats of to Connectix for making such a great product. I was playing with the still Connectix branded copy of Virtual PC and it runs Longhorn. [VMWare][3] has problems running windows XP BETAs and Windows 2003 server BETA and then it was fixed. Connectix just ran it without (a major) problem. Also, Virtual PC will sell for $129. this is $100 cheaper then when Connectix where selling it @ $229.
