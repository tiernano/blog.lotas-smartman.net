Right, that&#8217;s a bit of a mouthful for a title, but when has that ever stopped me! The guys over at [ISA Server.org][1] have a 2 part article showing you how to publish Outlook Web Access, Active Sync and RPC over HTTP, using ISA 2006. ([part 1][2] and [part 2][3]). The cool part of this is what that would allow you to do. OWA will allow you to access corporate email anywhere in the world that has an browser and Internet connection. ActiveSync lets you get your mail on your phone, and the RPC over HTTP allows you to use your laptop with full Outlook to get your full email experience, and all securely! very cool!</p>
