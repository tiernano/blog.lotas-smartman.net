So, i just started learning [VB.net][1] today and its looking quite cool. have to get it working at home. got VS.net 2002 in work, and 2003 at home. and the firewall and proxy at home are more forgiving then the one in here! im having problems connecting to web services though the proxy in here, and i dont know if its my code or the proxy/firewall. ill work on it when i get home though.
