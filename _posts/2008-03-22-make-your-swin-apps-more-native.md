[this tutorial on java.net][1] shows you how to make your swing apps more native looking. i was wondering how [eclipse][2] looked so much like windows on a windows box. anyway, its a 3 part series, but only one of them is up ATM. looks good though. Pity i cant make a java app look like OSX on a windows box&#8230;
