[this axim site tutorial shows you how to convert DVD movies into WMV files for your Pocket PC][1]. unfortunitly i only have a 64mb SD card at the moment, but i do have a few episodes of [Dilbert][2] on DVD, which, by my calculation, should fit on a 64mb card. i should be able to get at least one 25min episode into a 38mb wmv file, and if i use less then 210kbit/s encoding, which i probably will, just for testing, i could get 2 on a 64mb card. now to get me a 512mb SD Card or 256&#8230;
