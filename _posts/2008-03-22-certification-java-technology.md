[Certification &#8211; Java Technology][1]&nbsp;found this on the sun Java site. the next step up for me if i pass the [SUN CERTIFIED PROGRAMMER FOR THE JAVA 2 PLATFORM][2], which im doing tomorrow! but just to see what the next one up is, theres an upgrade exam to 1.4 certification (im currently doing the 1.2 exam). but the developer exam has ESSAY QUESTIONS!! The last time i had essay questions was Leaving Cert English! And i though that was bad. and then thats only one part of 2! the first part (essay questions is second part) is a practical exam. glad i dont have to get that, yet&#8230;.
