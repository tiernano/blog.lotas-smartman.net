Ok, that statment might sound strange to people who dont know me, and probably people who do know me too. My sound card, an external, USB Creative Sound Blaster (something or other, its not on the box) was disconnected from its USB and Power theaders a few weeks back, and has been lost since. Thats the reason there has been no PodCast. Well, i found it today, and i am sitting here, coding listening to [Jimmy Eat World][1]. Handy! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> [update] removed the 3 extra copies of that post. sorry.. My bad&#8230;
