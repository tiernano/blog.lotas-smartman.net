So, if you have been living under&nbsp;a rock, Macworld starts today and the the keynote is available here. Apple has announced a new [macbook][1] with a dual core intel proc, a [new imac][2] (which i likes) with, again a dual core intel proc, some new software (new [iWork][3] and [iLife][4] with [iWeb][5]) and a new copy of [iTunes][6]. very cool stuff. hopefully i got enough of the links in here! Ohhh, and new updates to [.Mac][7] too. random question: is the core duo 64bit? still watching the keynote, but someone said it runs windows ([Engadget said it][8], not me, but i will be sold if it works with windows!) [update] [new inline remote for the ipod too with a radio][9]. not sure about the radio part, but the remote could be handy&#8230; [update 2] TUAW has a bit on the [imac running windows][10], which nobody knows if it can yet&#8230; [update 3] incase i did miss something, Engadget have a round up of [todays news here][11].
