[this blog post][1] has some info on making a windows xp cd with SP1 and the security rollup package all in one. the one thing i would like to find out is how to get windows xp to install drivers for all my hardware in one. like the [Nvidia][2] drivers, the ones for my net card and all the rest. that would be more handy!
