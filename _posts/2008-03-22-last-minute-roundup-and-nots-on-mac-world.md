[think secret][1] have a round up on what is expeced at macworld. they say the mini ipods, a revamp of the originals too (some expect colored ipods. sounds interesting). also new software, or at leased updated versions of software. also they reckon updates to [XServe][2] but none to the desktops or laptop range. if there is no update to desktops, ill be upgrading the imac as [i said here][3]. so, only 2 hours or so to go. well 1 hour 50min by my watch, finished work in 30 min and should be home just in time. updates will be here.
