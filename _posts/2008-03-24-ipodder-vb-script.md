I found this though [Adam  
Currys weblog here][1]. Richard Todosikhuk has a [script  
on his site here][2] that copies new podcasts to an SD card, or any drive  
really. It uses the scripting in iTunes. This is a bit annoying. i cant find out  
how to script for windows media player yet. i would prefer using  
WMP&nbsp;because most of my music is in there anyway, and being able to script  
it like iTunes (remove dead tracks, create album play lists, etc) would be cool.
