ASSOCIATED PRESS: LOS ANGELES, July 4 &#8212; Velvet-voiced R&B crooner Barry White, renowned for his lush baritone and carnal lyrics that oozed sex appeal on songs such as &#8220;Can&rsquo;t Get Enough of Your Love, Babe,&#8221; died Friday morning, his manager said. White, who had suffered kidney failure from years of high blood pressure, died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center around 9:30 a.m., said manager Ned Shankman. He was 58. [[MSNBC][1]]
