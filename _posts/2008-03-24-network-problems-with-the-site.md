I dont know whats happening, but the site thss been timing out a few times over the last day or so. it happens in work and at home, and im getting text messages saying its down. weird. hopefully it will be fixed and sorry for the problems! thats the only problem about not running your site from home. you cant be blamed (which is a good thing) but you cant fix it either!
