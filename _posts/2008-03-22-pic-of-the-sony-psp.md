[this register article][1] has a pic of the new PSP. well, actually its a concept pic, but looks cool. Quote: <block_quote>the machine&#8217;s UMD media can hold up to two hours&#8217; of DVD-quality video or four hours &#8216;standard&#8217; quality</block_quote>. thats enough for quite a lot of music too. im guessing that works out at about 2Gbytes? probably more or less. info on the UMD [here][2] but no info on size. and theres photos of the PSP [here][3]. and form that last link its 1.8Gb duble layer UMD.
