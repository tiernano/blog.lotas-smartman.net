Wahoo! i just found out that pinging feedburner to update my site works. not that i though their software wouldent work, but because wordpress does not support it off hand. i found info <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/10/2019\">on how to get feedburner pinging other sites</a> and modified the code to get it to ping feedburner too. and now it works. takes some time to ping all sites (blo.gs, weblogs.com, yahoo and now feedburner) but its worth it! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
