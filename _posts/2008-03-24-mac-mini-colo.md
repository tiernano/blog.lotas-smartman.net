[Mac mini colo.net][1] are offering hosting of a mac mini in a colo facility for as little as $22.99 a month if you sign up before 15th march. this includes an ip address, 20gb bandwidth, your server managed business hours and monitored 24/7/365 and remote reboot. pretty cool. you can send them your own mac mini, or they will lease you one, but you lease for 24 months and then its yours. pretty cool. Also, when checking out that, i found [Pure Static][2]. They do hosting of files, and im guessing you could use them for images, etc. You are only charged for what you use, but there is a minimum of $25 and $2.10 per gb after that. In theory it sounds cool too. if i share a 10mb file and its downloaded 2500 times, it will cost me $25.63 to share that, or my calculation, thats 25 podcasts downloaded 100 times each. because of the minimum fee, its expencive for me there, but could be handy for others. I know there is also [Nearly Free Speech][3] which offer some other cooler features (like PHP and MySQL server hosting too). they charge $1 per gig transfered and $1 per gig hosted. i cant check their site now, which is strange. its either down or its a DNS issue on my ISA box. anyway, i think its $1 per day per gig hosted, or $1 per month per gig hosted. its something strange like that. but if it where that, by my calculations NFS would cost a total of about EUR18.74, which is a lot less then i am paying for my virtual dedicated server, and can be a lot faster when i want it to be! Hmmm. Even if the file size doubles to 20mb, i create 30 podcasts a month and i get 200 downloads, the total comes to EUR89.51. all calculations done based on $1 = 0.76EUR. Anyway, interesting&#8230;
