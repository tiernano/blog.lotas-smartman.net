I installed Thunderbird because Mail enable was being a pain in the ass with IMAP, and i though that was partly due to Outlook&nbsp;Express. Well, i was wrong. Outlook Express was only slow because Mail Enable was. [more about that here][1]. but when i installed Thunderbird, i decided to play around a bit and told it to use POP3 for mail, but to leave it on the machine. Since then, its being working grand. 7842 emails total in my inbox at the moment and it works nice. Anyway, i dident realise how cool this actually way. There is a threadding component, which allows you to see emails as a thread. and it works out who emailed who after when, so its properly threadded! also, keyboard short cuts are nice. if your reading a thread, you can hit &#8216;R&#8217; and all the messages in that thread are marked as read. You can watch threads, ignore threads, etc. lots of cool stuff. and it has built in RSS reader. now, why is this not in Outlook? now im not talking Express, i mean the full one? this has some sweet features, and i am only noticing this now. i found my POP3 and IMAP client for my workstation! i will still use Outlook for Exchange, becuase thats the best way, but this is tempting&#8230;
