Due to some technical difficuties with my hard drive, i might be installing windows on my machine pretty soon. im going to get my 2 chips this week (ordering them on monday or tuesday) and they should be here by thursday or firday. im getting the conductive paint on firday, and hopefully ill have the dual processor system running then. ill do some benchmark tests under linux, namly the kernel build time, and ill probably install Win2k or winXP again. i think my hard drive is a bit dead. wont work in DMA mode under linux, but its fully supported by the software. weird. and not only that, my phone, PDA and USB2 Card aint working either. <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> I will get linux back on when i get my new hard drives though! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
