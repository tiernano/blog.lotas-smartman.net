Right. just downloading [IntelliJ Idea][1]. Seems like a nice IDE. [Netbeans][2] is fairly cool, but its slow on my machine in work. so, just downloading it and seeing if its any good. its not free, but its got a 30 day trial for testing. @ $499, its more expencive then most java IDE&#8217;s (Netbeans being free, [Borlands][3] jbuilder personal being free too and [Eclipse][4] being free too). right. first impressions: This is fast! its a lot faster then netbeans. its nicer looking, has some sweet features, and something i just found but havent used yet, local CVS. so you cant break code too much, i think. have to see what else this does.
