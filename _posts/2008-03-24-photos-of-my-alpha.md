[here are some photos of my Alpha Server 1000A 4/266][1]. More photos later, probably. still trying to get it to boot properly. wont boot off CD for some reason. the first hard drive, a 2.1Gb drive, is dead. its probably going to take a while to figure out, but eventually ill get it. In other news, i just ordered a 4 port KVM switch and a 128mb SD memory card. this should make my life easer for administrating machines, etc. photos of that soon too! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
