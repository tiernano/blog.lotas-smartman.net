Right. just installed the CDR drive in the imac and it just caused havoc. the system boots but crashes. not sure why casue when i try boot without the cdrom drive, it does the same. it also wont boot from cd, yet, so im kind of lost when it comes to installing OSX. going to try a reinstall of OS9 tomorrow and see if that works.
