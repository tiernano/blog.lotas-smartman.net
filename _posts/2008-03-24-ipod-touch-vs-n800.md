TabletBlog.com has a nice&nbsp; article showing you [iPod touch VS Nokia N800][1]. They also have a very nice video showing you demos of the devices. Up until a few days ago, I was considering buying an iPod touch my self with my own money, but, I have kind of fallen for the N800, so instead I am buying an N800 (don&#8217;t ask when, I don&#8217;t have a date just yet) and will be dropping hints (like Anvils) around the house about the Touch as a birthday present&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> hint hint, wink wink!
