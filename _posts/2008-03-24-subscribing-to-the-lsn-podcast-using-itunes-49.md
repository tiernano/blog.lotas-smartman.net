Ok. just a quick note about subscribing to the LSN podcast using [iTunes 4.9 which was released a few hours ago][1]. to get it, drag the podcast URL&nbsp;(<http://lotas.libsyn.com/rss>) into the PodCasts section of iTunes. Alternitivly, copy the URL and go to Advanced, Subscribe to PodCast in iTunes and paste the URL in there. i have submitted my podcast to be displayed in iTunes, but i dont know when that will finally happen. Lets hope its soon!
