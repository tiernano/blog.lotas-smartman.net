It looks like 802.11g could be running at between 10 and 20mbits/s, not the original 54mb as once it was. the new draft, talked about [here][1] states that interoraprability with exsisting 802.11b networks needs to be kept, but a drop from 54 &#8211; 20mb seems a bit exsessive. though, in the the article it does state that 802.11g will run at 10 &#8211; 20mbits a second of not raw, but actuall speed. unlike 802.11b with a raw data rate of 11mb/s but a actual datarate about 1/2 that. interesting. original post [here][2] on slashdot.
