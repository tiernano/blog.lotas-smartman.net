I know i have only had it a few days, but even before i had it i knew i needed more ram. OSX likes lots of ram, like all OSes, and 256mb is not lots of ram. just look at my workstation. it has 512mb ram and acts slow after being left alone for a while. my server was telling me the other day that it had to restart some services because it was running out of ram, and it too has 512mb. my dell laptop has 768mb ram. i got that with 256mb and 2 weeks later upgraded it to the 768mb. it likes lots of ram, and i like having lots of ram in my systems. so, i need an extra 512mb DDR dimm (333Mhz) for my PowerBook. I will be buying it from [Shop4memory][1]. i talked about them a few times before. very cool place. and free shipping if your in the UK or Ireland. its an Irish company, and they do some cool things.
