[agent frank][1] is something i though of doing a while ago, except its done and works, i think. Right. it sits in between you and your internet connection and monitors what you visit. it then allows you to search though this using the web based interface. this is quite handy. its written in java and so far works, except it hasent crawled what i surfed yet. have to get this running at home. this would be so handy. think about it: you visit a site and forget to book mark it or cant find it on Google again. use this and it sees where you have been with that info in it. Sweet.
