This is quite strange. NTL seems to have broken something on my end, and now [www.apple.com][1] does not work. no response. cant traceroute to it or anything. same with <http://store.apple.com>. The even stranger thing is that my sisters computer, which has its own NTL cable modem connection has no problem in getting to the site&#8230; Really strange. anyway, its mothers day, so happy mothers day and i wont be posting a lot today. Headding out for dinner with the family. Talk to you tomorrow!
