the gods at [Amazon AWS][1] have spoken, and it is good! [EC2 will support Windows in the fall][2]! this is what i have been wanting for years, ever since EC2 was released! some thoughs about this:

  * running highly scalable web sites running on Win2k8 on EC2 at the front. using either SQL server with the help of [Elastic IP][3] and the [Elastic Block Store][4] for failover support, or using [SimpleDB][5]&nbsp;for storage.
  * kicking off EC2 instances to add to your pool of HPC machines for processing files, or doing any long running tasks.
  * a big desktop in the sky!

there are a lot more ideas that people could use this for, but this is big news at the moment, and i am very happy to hear this&#8230;. now wondering if i can get into the private beta&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
