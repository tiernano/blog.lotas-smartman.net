Cool Smart phone.com has [this article about the SPV 550][1], which in theory would be the iMate Smartphone 4 (or 3.5?) and will have a lot of other names too! it would have a QVGA display, 1.3Mp camera, and dedicated media player buttons. Looks interesting, but i dont know if its true. I had a hands on with the MPX 220 yesterday, and im already looking at that as a replacment to the Smartphone 2, but this looks nice&#8230;
