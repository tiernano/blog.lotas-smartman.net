Today, Data Robotics released their new device, the [Drobo Pro][1]. Basically, its a large [Drobo][2] with 8 SATA Drive bays, 2 FireWire 800 Ports, a USB 2 port and GigE Network connection for iSCSI support.

&#160;

The iSCSI piece is not for sharing between multiple machines, from what i can gather, but designed as a faster than the 800mb/s that firewire gives way of connecting to your Drobo. 

The Drobo has always been an interesting idea, but i am still not 100% convinced… I have my [Windows Home Server][4], which currently has a fair amount of storage on it, and can do a lot more than the Drobo can (can be connected to multiple machines, has support for backing them up, etc). I have even gotten it acting as a SVN server ([part 1][5] and [part 2][6]). \`

I can see an advantage to Drobo (all managed in one box, easy access to drives, etc). but 8 drives is still limiting… No USB upgrade, no PATA support… All stuff i have with my current (Home Built) Home Server…
