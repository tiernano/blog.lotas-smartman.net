[O&#8217;Reilly Network: Microsoft Smartphone Tips and Tricks [May. 14, 2004]][1]. I want one of these. but which one do i get. do i buy the [MPx200][2] which is out now, runs Windows Pocket PC edition 2003, and has 10mb ram (or so) or do i get the [MPx300][3], which wont be out for a while, which has bluetooth, WIFI, and built in camera, but is going to cost a lot more. no idea on prices for the 300, but you can guess in the region of 600EUR+! Hmmm. Decisions, decisions&#8230;
