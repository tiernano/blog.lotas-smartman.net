If you have a media center, and you want your media center remote to do other things (like turn on and off the TV, turn the volume up and down on your amp), [check out this article showing you how][1]. if your remote can do it, that is. it would be handy to get it to turn the TV on and off, since i keep loosing the remote, and also to play with the amp audio!
