OK. i am now running .TEXT on my site, and there are some problems with it, but, hopefully i can get them fixed eventually. So far i like this a lot. i like the ability to use a web service to post stuff to it. Also, because it written in C# i can modify it too. I hope to get some code to get enclosures working so i can use it for my podcasts. 

I will post more later, but until then, good night.
