Hello Tiernan,

I checked on that board and it will only take MP chips. I myself thought

it depended on the chip but I checked with one of the other guys here and

that board is MP only. I belive you can run it with one non MP chip in it

but thats it.

It will take normal DDR memory, doesn&#8217;t need any kind of ECC or registered

memory to work. You&#8217;ll deffently save quite a bit if you have some spare

RAM.

I can&#8217;t see why not but you&#8217;d want to check the max current on the 5v

line. This board needs at least 30A on it, if the PSU has a figure above

30 it should be okay, if its dead on 30A I&#8217;d say it could go either way.

Once again I can see why not, you&#8217;d just need to change a seeting in the

BIOS so that the board won&#8217;t look for a floppy when booting.

You can find bit more information on the board itself at

If you have any more questions just send us a mail and I&#8217;ll do my best to

answer them
