Eirler on i mentioned that Longhorn would require a Dual ocre 4-6Gz PC with 1Tb of hard drive space and a minimum of 2Gb of ram. well [scoble has responsed, but not directly to me][1]. he was responding to the article that i got my info from. I should really read [his blog][2] before i post any Longhorn news. He is saying that its being developed and tested on 3Gz P4s with 1Gb ram. some systems are 64bit from either Intel or AMD, but the idea of a dual core chip being needed is not true. Still, id say it would be an advantage! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
