Right. so [OSNews has a post asking users to post their setup][1] they are currently using&#8230; I was going to post a comment with mine, but though it would take up too much space&#8230; so, here is mine. Leave a comment if you wish with your setup&#8230;

**Main workstation: **There was a [series of posts about this machine][2], and the v.next has now become the v.current. This machine currently acts as Dev Workstation, Hyper-V Server, and anything else i need a big fast machine for (Photo processing, Video Editing and conversion, etc) Specs are as follows:

Dual Xeon (Nehamam) 2.26Gz (Quad core, Hyper Threaded)  
12Gb DDR 3 Memory  
2 300Gb Western Digital Velociraptors (Raid 0 for boot and system drives)  
2 1Tb Western Digital Caviar Black Drives (Raid 1 for Data)  
NVidia GeForce 275 Graphics with 896mb ram  
Running Windows Server 2008 R2.

**Proliant Server (Hyper-V, Active Directory Domain Controller (secondary), DNS (Secondary), DHCP)**  
Intel Xeon 2.6Gz, Dual core  
5 Gb Ram (DDR2 IIRC)  
Currently got a 250Gb boot drive, and 2 500 Gb data drives, but this will change when the SAN gets built&#8230;  
Windows 2008 Server (upgrading to R2 soon)

**Mac Pro (Hyper-V Server, Remote Desktop Gateway)  
**Dual proc, Dual Core Xeon 2.66Gz  
12Gb RAM  
2 74Gb Western Digital Raptors  
ATI Radion 9600GT Graphics (512mb ram)  
Windows Server 2008 R2

**Opteron Box (IIS, SQL Active Directory! only found out its setup for this now!)**  
Dual Opteron processor (old style, no Virtualization Technology, not even Dual core!)  
2GB RAM (maxed out!) this is a SFF Box&#8230;  
80Gb HDD  
Windows Server 2008  
Very basic box&#8230; Does the job, and nothing else&#8230;

**Poweredge (Active Directory (Primary), DNS (Primary))**  
2.4Gz P4 Xeon (Hyper threaded, 64 bit and nothing else)  
768Mb RAM&#8230;  
80Gb HDD  
Windows Server 2003 (Yup&#8230; its old!)  
This used to act as the main webserver, SQL, ISA and Exchange box in the house, but it got old and needed to be replaced. now its just a nice little Active Directory box&#8230; Eventually planning on paving, upgrading the RAM and keeping just for AD and DNS. Maybe even a bit of file sharing&#8230;

**Laptop (main working laptop, college notes, messing around when im board box&#8230;)  
**MacBook Pro  
2.4Gz Core 2 Duo processor  
4Gb RAM  
250Gb (i think) HDD  
Dual boot Win 7 X64 Ultimate and OSX 10.6 (Mostly Win7)  
Its a Late 2008 UniBody MacBook Pro&#8230; More specs if yo go looking for it&#8230; Too lazy to look now&#8230;

**NetBook (Messing with the MacBook is too big)**  
MSI Wind  
Atom 1.6Gz Processor  
2Gb RAM  
160Gb HDD  
Windows 7

So, thats about it&#8230; What have you got?
