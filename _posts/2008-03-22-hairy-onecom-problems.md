Right. the-hairy-one.com is having DNS Problems. its not a problem in getting to the site, but a problem in using it. see, its getting its data live from [DMoz][1] but for some reason the DNS server on the server is not working. this is due to a reboot at [JVDS][2] becasue of a new kernel. the DNS config is not running properly. and to make matters worse, i cant get access to the server from here. well, that being said i have limited access to the machine though webmin, but its also behind a firewall and slow. im trying to work on this problem now.
