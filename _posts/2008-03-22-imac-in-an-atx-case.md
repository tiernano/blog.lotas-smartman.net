[this page][1] shows you how somone managed to get an iMac Revision D (like the one i have) into an ATX Case. this is a handy conversion. i have me a Revision D iMac and this would be cool, but even better is the fact that they managed to get a standard IDE cdrom drive working with it. so, im going to try this when i get home. i have a spare DVDRom drive now, so ill see if it works. could be run. may end up putting in the CDR Drive insted.
