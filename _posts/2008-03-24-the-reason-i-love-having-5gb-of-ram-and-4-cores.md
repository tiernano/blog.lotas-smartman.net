the main system is my Mac pro, with 5Gb of ram and 2 Dual core Xeons at 2.66Gz. the next is my Win2k3 Virtual Dev box running VS Orcas (1.5Gb of ram available to it) and then my Win2k8 BETA 3 VM, with 1Gb of ram available to it. The system is running very nicley and no issues found! I Love this&nbsp;machine! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

PS: trying something new with the images, so if they are slow, leave a comment&#8230; I will explain more later, but at the moment, live testing will be interesting <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
