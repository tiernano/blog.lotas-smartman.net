So, what does Blog Rush, Vista, Stability, iTunes Plus and the Zune have in common? This post probably! 

<a class href="http://www.blogrush.com/r36547965" mce_href="http://www.blogrush.com/r36547965"><img src="http://images.lotas-smartman.net/image.ashx?id=9f1077f1-43ea-4e60-a30a-77552b12b4d4" align=right border=0 mce_src="http://images.lotas-smartman.net/image.ashx?id=9f1077f1-43ea-4e60-a30a-77552b12b4d4"></a> So, <a class href="http://www.blogrush.com/r36547965" mce_href="http://www.blogrush.com/r36547965">Blog Rush</a>. If you read my blog directly instead of though RSS feeds or somewhere else, you will have noticed the big Blog Rush Widget at the side. It kind of just arrived and I never explained it. Its basically a way of increasing traffic on your blog. You sign up at the <a class href="http://www.blogrush.com/r36547965" mce_href="http://www.blogrush.com/r36547965">Blog Rush homepage</a>, put the code on your blog, and your pretty much good to go. It uses your RSS feed as a source of info, and places the title on different sites, increasing your blogs potential reading count. Very cool, and working fairly well for me so far.

Next, we have Vista stability. If anyone has any questioned the stability of vista, check out the following screen shot, from my machine just a few minutes ago. Most important part is highlighted in yellow:

Yep. that&#8217;s 443 hours. by my calculations, that&#8217;s 18days 10 hours, 15min. no where near a record. SCSIBox (my proxy/DHCP/DNS/secondary domain controller box) is currently in at 65 days 21 hours, PowerEdge (which is Web/SQL/DNS/Primary Domain Controller/Exchange box) is at 17 days 4 hours, and my Dual Opteron (running Windows 2008 Server RC and acting as a Virtual Server) is up&nbsp;16 days 19 min. 

Finally, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/music.html" mce_href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/music.html">iTunes Plus</a> and <a href="http://www.zune.net/" mce_href="http://www.zune.net">Zune</a>. Weird combination, you may think, but, after some testing (2 Phil Collins Songs) it works! Coke Cola had a promotion on a while back in Ireland, where you could win iTunes songs by texting in a code on Coke cans. I won a couple of songs, but never bought anything. iTunes plus, back then, would not work, since they where EUR1.29 a song, and the code only worked for 99c songs. But iTunes prices have changed, and now, <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/10/17itunes.html" mce_href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/10/17itunes.html">iTunes Plus songs are 99c</a>. So, I bought 2 Phil Collins Songs (In the air tonight and Another Day in Paradise) and they work perfectly on the Zune. just drag them into the Zune software, add them to a playlist synced to the Zune, and your good to go! <div class=wlWriterSmartContent id=0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:ccb6e2aa-5c32-4c8e-8870-b608b5365020 contentEditable=false style="PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; DISPLAY: inline; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; FLOAT: none; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Zune" rel=tag mce_href="http://technorati.com/tags/Zune">Zune</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/iTunes" rel=tag mce_href="http://technorati.com/tags/iTunes">iTunes</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Phil%20Collins" rel=tag mce_href="http://technorati.com/tags/Phil%20Collins">Phil Collins</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Coke" rel=tag mce_href="http://technorati.com/tags/Coke">Coke</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Virtual%20Server" rel=tag mce_href="http://technorati.com/tags/Virtual%20Server">Virtual Server</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/PowerEdge" rel=tag mce_href="http://technorati.com/tags/PowerEdge">PowerEdge</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/SCSIBox" rel=tag mce_href="http://technorati.com/tags/SCSIBox">SCSIBox</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Opteron" rel=tag mce_href="http://technorati.com/tags/Opteron">Opteron</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Windows%202008%20Server" rel=tag mce_href="http://technorati.com/tags/Windows%202008%20Server">Windows 2008 Server</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Blog%20Rush" rel=tag mce_href="http://technorati.com/tags/Blog%20Rush">Blog Rush</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Uptime" rel=tag mce_href="http://technorati.com/tags/Uptime">Uptime</a></div></p>
