Apple has released new [iBooks][1] and new [Mac Minis][2]. The iBooks now have 1.33Gz processors in the 12&#8243; model and 1.42Gz in the 14&#8243;. both come with 512mb ram, and start at $999. the mac mini now comes with built in wireless as standard (i think), 512mb ram, and start at the same $499. there is now a third one to the line though. it will come with super drive, wifi, bluetooth and 80gb hdd. the apple stores are still half up, half down, so dont go buying one, just yet!
