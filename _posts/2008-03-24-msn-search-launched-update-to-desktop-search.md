MSN Search has officially been launched. [More on  
the MSN Search weblog][1]. In other MSN news, Tere is a new build of the [MSN  
Desktop Search][2]. Also, i am now using MSN search more then Google, on certin  
machines and at certin times. on my desktop, which has the MSN toolbar in IE  
about 90% of the time, and the google toolbar about 10% of the time, i use the  
msn more. this is obvious. that being said, on my laptop, which up till a few  
days ago when i formatted my machine, had both the MSN and Google desk bars  
installed, and both poped up most of the time in IE, i would use MSN most of the  
time, still. thats just me sharing useless info.
