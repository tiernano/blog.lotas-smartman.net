> Hey AOL &#8211; you&#8217;ve continued to block legit Lockergnome newsletters from entering mailboxes across the world. We thought we had the problem solved, but apparently someone on your end is still screwing up. Meanwhile, thousands of people are asking us why they&#8217;re not receiving our content through e-mail. Is it time for me to alert members of the press that you&#8217;re censoring people who pay for your service? I think so. [[C:\PIRILLO.EXE]][1]

hmmmm. interesting. I have a spam filter on my server, but it only changes the title of the email. thats it. it still sends it, but thats incase of this reason. AOL should have something setup where it puts email into a dir and if you get mail that AOL thinks is spam, but isent, you can un-spam-ify it.
