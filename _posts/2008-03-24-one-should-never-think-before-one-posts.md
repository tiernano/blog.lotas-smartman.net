> > One should never think before one posts. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s been my big blunder. And one should never ever ever rewrite, fine-tune, or God forbid edit the post, either. As a blogger, you should form a picture in your mind of a man drinking a cup of coffee. Then imagine that he suddenly feels a dead fly on his tongue and here youÃ¢â¬â¢ll see your role model. Let your words spew forth with speed and velocity, out of reflex and not reflection. Let them fly without any possibility of ever taking them back. And when challenged, insist that the challenger is lucky that you donÃ¢â¬â¢t sue somebody, and if he or she thinks youÃ¢â¬â¢re going to help clean that up, theyÃ¢â¬â¢re crazy. <div align=right>

I mean, while I do aspire to doing some real writing (when IÃ¢â¬â¢m not so busy with work, as I have been of late), my blog-a-day writing shouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t be all that painful. It looks like my serverÃ¢â¬â¢s on its last legs and the act of posting itself takes forever, so belaboring the actual content so much just puts the last straw on the [shaven yakÃ¢â¬â¢s][4] back.
