[Last night i complained that my mac was crashing a lot][1] while ripping a CD. I never though to think it was the ram i borrowed out of the other machine. well, i think it might be. i am not totally sure, and i will be checking now, but if it is, i hope to have this problem solved soon&#8230; **[update]** Yeah, it was the RAM. i took the second 256mb out and it works grand. so i then took the original 256mb out and put the 512mb out of the dell and put it in the PB and put the other 256mbs into the Dell. so both now still have 512mb, but i havent crashed the mac yet.
