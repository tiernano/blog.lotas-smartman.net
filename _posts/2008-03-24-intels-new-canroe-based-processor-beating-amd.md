Well, i cant remember the last time i seen Intel beating AMD in a processor head to head, but it has happened this time. check out [this article over at Hot Hardware][1] showing you what the new Canroe based processor at 2.66Gz, dual core, can do. Interesting results. wonder how long it will take AMD to catch up&#8230;
