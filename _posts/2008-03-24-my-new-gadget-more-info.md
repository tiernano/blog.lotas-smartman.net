Yesterday I mentioned [I got a new gadget][1]. Well, actually I mentioned it twice, because [last night I posted a post about it, on it.][2] Well, here it is: 

[<img alt="HTC Universal / XDA Exec / iMate JasJar" src="http://static.flickr.com/150/379375869_372c98714c_m.jpg" border="0" />][3]

The photo is of the XDA Exec, which is another name for the HTC Universal. Mine is an iMate JasJar, which is the same as the HTC universal. Its a bit complicated, but there all the same (except the o2 XDA Exec, which is in a nice black. mine is a kind of silver gray). 

So I got it yesterday, and I love this thing. In the [post about the hammer][4], that photo came from the JasJar&#8217;s camera. And the post I made last night was using [Opera][5] on the JasJar in full 640X480 resolution, over a Wifi connection. 

That&#8217;s the party piece of the JasJar: Full VGA screen. I actually, this morning, Remote Desktop&#8217;ed into my servers to check something, while on the JasJar! Absolutely perfect! 

Now for some developing! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
