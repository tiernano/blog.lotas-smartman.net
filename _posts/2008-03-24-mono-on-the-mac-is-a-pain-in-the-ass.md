Im trying to install [Mono][1], [Fink][2], [GTK#][3] and some other things, but for some reason the Developer tools that i have installed on OSX wont work. complete pain in the ass. i might actually have to reinstall OSX 10.3 on the mac and try again. i might just wait till 10.4 Tiger is released and do it then, but its a bit annoying&#8230; Also, anyone know where i can get a self install super drive for a Aluminium powerbook? somewhere in Europe preferably but the states might do too.
