Ok, this grid computing idea is really cool. being able to build applications that can process data using multiple machines is something i am very intrested in, both profesionally and personally. I wont go into details on the profesional level (due to NDAs etc) but some ideas of personal projects include photo , video and audio processing.&nbsp; the more machines used for these tasks, the quicker andthey can be processed.

Well, this one is very interesting.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/silverlight/gridcomputing.aspx" mce_href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/silverlight/gridcomputing.aspx">Legion is a Code Project article</a>, written by Daniel Vaughan,and it uses ASP.NET web serivces for the back end and Silver light for the processing! this is really cool! and because its a web based client, there is no installation (other then the silverlight run time). Very cool stuff!
