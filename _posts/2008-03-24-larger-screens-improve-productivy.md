this post over at slashdot talks about an Apple sponsored study about [larger screens helping Productivy][1]. i have been using 2 20&#8243; flat monitors (wide screen) over the last few weeks, and i will say that yea, extra screen estate makes life a lot easer! now, i dont know if 1 30&#8243; display would make a big difference for me, cause i usually have a LOT of stuff open at home time, but 2 large monitors do help. I have a few machines in work, and one has 2 monitors pluged into it. I often find my self trying to drag stuff to another monitor on the machine that only have one attached. If i rember correctly, there was a study about Dual, or multi, monitor systems improving productivy even more? (see this [Live.com search results][2] on the question, with some interesting links)&#8230;
