[New Zone Alarm to warn of viruses.][1] Zone alarm was always good to me when being used as a firewall, but its been a while. this could be on my recomendation list if someone needs a good firewall and doesent have XP. then again, depending on a few things, i may even recomend this for XP users too. built in virus scan is pretty cool, especially in a firewall.
