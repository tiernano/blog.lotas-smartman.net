Engadget has some news about a [posible proper leaked copy of Tiger for the x86][1]. I havent seen a torrent for it yet, but they reckon this could be feasible. You need a fully working copy of Darwin before you can begin, and there are none of the iLife apps packages with the torrent. Sounds interesting. I wonder will it work on Virtual PC/Server or VMWare?
