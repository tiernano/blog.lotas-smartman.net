I got into work this morning, booted the laptop and opened IE, and staring me in the face is a dotTEXT error message telling me my SQL server was dead. to make a long story boring, it wasent, and my workstation, which has been on for the last 4 weeks or so, ran out of resources, killed SQL server, and just died. So, its back now. sorry about that.
