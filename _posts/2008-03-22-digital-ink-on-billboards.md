[Digital ink on billboards][1] is a slashdot article about a company, named [Magink][2] who have created billboards using digital ink. Cool idea this. now the only question: Can this be used in a news paper? i know there was talk about this before, but if it could, when you walk past your local news agents, or connect to the net though your mobile phone, you can get news updates straight to the paper. [heres the how stuff works article on it][3]!
