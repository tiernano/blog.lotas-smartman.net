<p mce_keep="true">A while back, i was writing a peice of code for work which had quite a lot of SQL queries. which i had tried reduicing, but couldent reduice any more. during the testing phase, i found that it was running at roughtly&nbsp;1-2 queries a second, which, i was told, was slow. So, i asked someone, who is more scooled in the art of SQL performance tuning, what i should do. he had a look at the database and said i should read up on Indexes. After some reading of what ever SQL 2000 and 2005 books i could find my hands on, i increesed preformace to 10-15 queries per second! Not bad!</p> <p mce_keep="true">Well, for you out there who would like to learn more about these SQL indexes, check out this [SQL Team post introducing SQL Indexing][1]. </p>
