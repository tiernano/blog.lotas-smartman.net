[Slashdot are reporting that google][1] plans to give back some code to the community. now i wonder. will this be code to do with Linux since google uses a few thousand linux boxen in its network and they want to show how they do that or will it be search technology. my guess is something to do with linux since their search technology is their most important asset and i cant see them giving that away. there might be license restrictions too. though if its to do with linux, it might be GPLed. theres a lot of mights in this equasion. it may be a while before we see anything, but thats something we will keep our eye on&#8230;
