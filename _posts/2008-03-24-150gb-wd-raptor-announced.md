[Western Digital has announced a new 150Gb Raptor][1]. this is the 10k RPM drive which is aimed at servers and high end workstations. I was kind of hoping for a SATA2 model, but, this would still be cool. Ideally i want 2 of these in a raid 1 array for my Boot drive, with a nice 2+TB Data drive&#8230;. SWEET! i can dream, cant i? <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
