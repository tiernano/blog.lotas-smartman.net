Linksys have released a new router, the [WRT54GX][1] with SRX (Speed and Range eXpansion) technology. up to 3x range of standard 802.11g and upto 8x the speed (which by my calculation is 432mb/s). its backward compatible with other 802.11b and g devices too. no link to the card for this, and no word weather its hackable like the WRT54G which runs linux. If its does run Linux, its cool cause its hackable. i got some neat extras for my WRT54G because of hacking it.
