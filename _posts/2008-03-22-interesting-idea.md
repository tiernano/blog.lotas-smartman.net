Ok. [Slashdot.org][1] have this article about a program called konspire2b. Its a p2p like application that allows you to subscribe to channels and then recive data when it is updated. its an interesting idea, and i would think about it for the blog. if i could get it to automaticlly send the blog files to users, then you could subscribe and every time i add a new post or update something, it would be sent to you. if i where to release [software][2] it could be delevered to you too. you could help by sharing the file that was sent to you, which i think is done automaticly. it will take some though. but good none the less.
