I will be a [Seti@Home][1] user for 2 years come tomorrow some time (about 26 hours from now). Im just checking my stats and as of 13.17, or when this post was posted, i reached 1999 units. the stats page is [here][2]. there can be anywhere from 1 &#8211; 120min between now and the time i hit the 2000 mark. give or take a few min. well i supose it could be 240min. i do 2 units every 4 hours, and it depends on the way the cpu&#8217;s have been working. if their sending units at the same time, which is rare, it will be 2 every 4 hours, but if not its one every 2 or so. Hmmm.
