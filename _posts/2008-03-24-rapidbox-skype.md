[the rapidBox Skype Router look interesting][1]. I actually really like this idea. though, i dont use my PSTN Line that much, this could be sweet for reciving calls from people who dont have broadband or skype. You plug your PSTN line into the box, and your standard phone, or 2 if you want, then you plug it all into USB. using the software installed and skype, you can then make calls to either skype users, skype out calls or standard PSTN calls. Interesting. I might be getting one of these&#8230;
