[WaveHunt][1] is a competition being run in Dublin City where contestents try and find a Linksys WRT54G WIFI router which will be carried by someone around different places (Stephens Green Park, Stephens Green Shopping Center and Temple Bar). The shopping centre will be a pain in the ass since its multi story (4 i think including the ground floor), Temple bar has a fair amout of Wifi spots, and the park is fairly large and if your the other end of the park, you might not get signal. Prize money is 200EUR, and it costs 10EUR to join. Cool idea!
