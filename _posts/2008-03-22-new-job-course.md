I was just accepted for a [Fas][1] course in [Baldoyle][2]. Its a [Software developer traineeship][3] and i learn Java, which i have wanted to do for some time now, i also become MS Certified, in what i dont know yet, and i also get a few weeks (12 or 13 i think) in work experiance. So, I start on Wendaday 23rd April, but i dont finish college till about May 12th i think. so theres going to have to be some strings pulled there!!! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> Im to see them tommorow and ill be in college wendsday. Ohhh, and i forgot to mention i actually did the Aptitude Test with them, an [SRA Aptitude test][4] which was weird because the hard questions (fill in the flow diagram, maths, formulas and number questions) where quite easy, the the easy-ish ones (English questions) where hard! its mad! im a proper programmer! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
