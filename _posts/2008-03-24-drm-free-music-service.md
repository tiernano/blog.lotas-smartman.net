Looks like MP3.com founder, Michael&nbsp;Robertson, will be opening a [new music store next week][1], and there will be no restrictions on the music. it wont be DRMed WMAs or&nbsp;iTunes files,&nbsp;but it wont have DRM at all. this sounds interesting. So no more worrying if your portable music device will play music you buy from an online music store. I dont know if these are MP3 files, or some other non DRM format, though, but 88c per song or $8.88 per album. We will see what happens&#8230;
