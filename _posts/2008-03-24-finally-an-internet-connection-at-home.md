But, unfortunitly, not broadband. i was told yesterday by someone in NTL that there is a problem with the outside line, and i will be informed of times when this could be fixed on monday. which is 8 days after i was disconnected last, and aout 12 since i was disconnected first. this is now getting annoying. dialup sucks, but unfortunitly, there is nothing i can do about it. now to try and figure out a way to get my mail back. its all (hopefully) stored on [Zone Edits][1] server. i will know on monday how long it will be before i get reconnected. hopefully it wont be too long&#8230;
