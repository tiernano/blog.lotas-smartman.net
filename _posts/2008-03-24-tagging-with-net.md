I have been playing with some code from [Coding4Fun][1] and came up with an app, which is very primitive, that allows some sort of tagging to be done with a peice of text. The term extraction part is out of [this coding4fun article][2], and i am just using that with [Technorati][3] to make Tags. i dont know if they are real tags, but who cares? (probably technorati, but hmmm). anyway, i may post code later. still got some tweaking to do&#8230;
