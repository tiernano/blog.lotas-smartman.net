Well, [Aperture 1.5][1] was announced a few days back (i posted info on the [photography blog here][2]) and yesterday we started to see lots of Mac updates being released (iLife and iWork was updated to support Aperture 1.5). This afternoon started with a 200Mb+ download of OSX 10.4.8, and Aperture has just hit the update site now weighing in at a stagering 125mb (well, i say stagering, but its not too bad. its taken about 5 min to download&#8230;). But who says macs dont have lots of updates? Total downloaded from Apple for updating this mac since i got it is roughtly 1.2Gb+&#8230;
