just had an idea. not sure how this will work, but i will try it anyway. Basicly, an add on to [WordPress][1]written in [ASP.NET][2]. the addon is a web service that connects directly to the data base ([MySQL][3]) that word press uses. since the service is easy to use in [VB.NET][4], [C#][5], etc, it makes it a lot more programmable. i have tried may ways to get [VB.NET][4] to talk to the XMLRPC backend in [WordPress][1], but never with any luck. this could help, plus i could then write apps for my PocketPC and Smartphone! So, i will be posting code somewhere, not sure where yet, but watch this space.
