I seen [Bruce Almighty][1] a while ago. Man is it funny. [Jim Carrey][2] is just one funny bloke. Jim plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who wants to be the ancorman at his station. He doesent get the job and is quite angry at the guy who actually does. when his girl friend Grace (played by [Jennifer Aniston][3]) tells him to pray, he starts to laff and gets angry at god. He gets a beeper message to go talk to someone, even after his beeper has been run over by a car. he goes and meets God ([Played by Morgan Freeman][4]). God then gives Bruce his powers for a while and then all the fun starts. Its a very funny movie and is just very very good. Also has [Catherine Bell][5] in it. Very good film!!!
