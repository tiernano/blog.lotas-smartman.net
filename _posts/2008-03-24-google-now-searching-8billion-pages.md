[Google has nearly doubled their index to over 8 billion][1]. thats a lot of documents. [9890][2] are from my blog as of writing, and [10500][3] from the-hairy-one.com, but only 8 are shown. this proves i have to fix that site! DAMN! anyway, looks like i will have to do some hacking over the weekend&#8230;
