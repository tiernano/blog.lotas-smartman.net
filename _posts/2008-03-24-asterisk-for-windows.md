I habe been thinking over the last while of build an [Asterisk][1] box so i could have VOIP around my house, and make cheap calls, and also get rid of the Eircom land line. Well, today i found [Asterisk win32][2], a version of astrerisk for Windows! very cool. I will be installing this and playing around to see what happens! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
