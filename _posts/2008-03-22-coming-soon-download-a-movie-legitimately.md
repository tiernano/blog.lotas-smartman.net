Revelations Entertainment to allow downloads of one of its films next year. [[Ars Technica][1]] now that i would like to see. wonder what format this will be in. more then likely either WMV or DivX. still, its a nice thing to see. wonder how many other movie companies will do this. im suprised that someone like Pixar dident do this first since all their films are digital in the first place.
