[HP touts blade PC | The Register][1]. Blade PCs heay? looks interesting. this could actually save me a lot of trouble. im not thinking of going out and spending a bucket load on blade PCs but thin clients make sense. if i can get my sisters machine to boot, connect to the network and then automagiclly connect to a terminal services machine, let her log on, and do what ever she wants (with limited premissions of course!) it would make me happy cause i wouldent have to update her machine every time theres a new patch, i wouldent have to wory about the amount of ram in her system, cause the server would have the ram. now to find out more on terminal services&#8230;.
