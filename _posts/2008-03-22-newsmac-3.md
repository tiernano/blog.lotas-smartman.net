Found this [NewsMac 3][1] on [MacNN here][2]&nbsp;and it looks pretty cool. its an Free RSS&nbsp;reader, with built in Sync support for Palm and iPods. I just installed it on the mac, and it works well. trying to install the Palm Software so i can see what its like syncing with it. Still havent gotten my new [Treo 90][3] yet, but i think it should be here in the next few days. also ordered a Bluetooth adapter for it so i can surf the web while on the bus! not only that but i can surf the interner though my broadband connection when im at home! looks cool so far though.
