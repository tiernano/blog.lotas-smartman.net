Right. so i wanted to see how fast it took my new powerbook to rip a CD. so i poped it in the drive, itunes loads and i hit the import button. it ripped the first 3 or 4 songs and then vanished! i get an error message saying itunes crashed. do you want to send an error report to Apple. so i say no, thinking it as a one off thing. so i try it again. and again it crashed. after 3 different crashes, at different points in the CD, i finally decided to rip half, and then rip the second half. and it worked. but so much for OSX being stable! it has crashed on me more times in the last few days then windows has in the last few months!
