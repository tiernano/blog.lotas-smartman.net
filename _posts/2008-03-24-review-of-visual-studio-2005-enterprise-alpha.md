[check out this review of Visual studio 2005 Enterprise Alpha][1]. 40 min to install on a P4 with 256mb ram and win2k3server EE? I think you need more ram! 256 on a server is a little silly, and with a processor like the P4, you really should have more. Speaking of ram, the laptop will get a memory upgrade some time early next week. just ordered a 512mb DDR 2700 DIMM for it and it should be here either monday or tuesday. If your in Ireland or the UK check out [Shop4Memory][2]. Free shipping to the UK and Ireland (irish company so shipping to ireland is quicker) and they ship to Europe, but dident check a price. I installed VS2005 Community preview and it took about an hour on my laptop. that was installing over a WLAN connection though&#8230;
