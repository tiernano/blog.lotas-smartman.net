I found this [article over at Engadget][1] about some new mac mini accessories: The [mini Tower][2] and the [mini Skirt][3]. The company who make these, [Plastic Smith][4], also have an other mac mini accessory: [the grand stand][5]. this goes over your mac mini and you place your monitor on top. i supose its for better support of the monitor. the mini tower looks interesting, and it would be something i would think of getting, but the skirt is a bit, well, strange. if you want your mac up that bit heigher, thats why phone books or other books are for! the tower i can see a reason for, and the grand stand too. anyway, interesting&#8230;
