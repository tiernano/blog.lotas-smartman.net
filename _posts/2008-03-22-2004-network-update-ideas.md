Ok. its not sully being decided yet, but i have an idea of the network upgrade for 2004. Firstly, I&#8217;m going to get the second 120Gb Western Digital Hard drive for the work station, and bring it to the 240 GB level. Then, I&#8217;m getting 2 more for the server, and moving the server from the Duron 700 to the Athlon 1.3Gz. The server will be getting extra memory (up from the current 256 to probably 512 or 768mb. Next in the Duron to get an upgrade. extra memory and probably a new hard drive. Final upgrade will be to the mac. a new hard drive and memory, and maybe a new case like [like i posted about here][1]. If i get the new case, a standard CDR drive will be put in too. I think thats about it. i would like to add memory to the workstation to bring it up to about 1.5gb but because i used standard DDR memory when i built it, i would have to buy 1.5Gz off Registered DDR or ECC memory and at 2-3x the price of the normal stuff, its expensive. it may not happen this year, but we can see&#8230;
