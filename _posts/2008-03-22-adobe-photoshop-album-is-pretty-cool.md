yesterday <a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1006844.html\">russell was talking about the 7610</a> and was saying that <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopalbum/\">adobe photoshop album</a> did a lot of stuff that lifeblog did. well, I decided to try this photoshop album and see what it was like. so I downloaded the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopalbum/starter.html\">starter edition</a> and was impressed. then, while looking for something else I found the driver and software disk for my sisters digital camera. thinking at first that it was only the starter edition, checked the cd closer and found it to be the full copy! sweet. so, playing woth it now. nice software. and a nice tip for you too. I dident realise wheb you select a load of photos on a nokia, you can send them all via bluetooth! so pretty cool anyway!
