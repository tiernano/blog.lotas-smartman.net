HDR (High Dynamic Range) photography is a method of taking multiple exposures  
of a single photograph and merging them together. It comes out with some  
interesting results! Check out [this page  
with some shots of Tokyo made in this way][1]. Also, there is a tutorial ([part 1][2]  
and [2][3]) about  
how to do this too. Very cool stuff!
