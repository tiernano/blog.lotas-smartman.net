Ok, so, if i get some time this weekend, i will be doing some coding of my [Photography Site][1]&nbsp;which i havent thouched in a while. but i found some interesting links which may be of use to me. Both are on Code Project. First in the [creating a watermarked phtograph with GFI+&nbsp;for .NET][2]. This is something i have been looking for for a while now. Next is [Ceixf][3], which allows you to pull EXIF Data from your JPEGs. Very handy stuff.
