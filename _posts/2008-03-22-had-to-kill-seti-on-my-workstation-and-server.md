Ok. i installed [Motherboard Monitor][1] on my workstation and after a reboot, it worked. it then started beeping at me. it told me my chip was running at 72 Deg Celcus!!! Ahhh! so i just killed seti, and now its running at 59 Deg C. my processor in the server is running quite hot too, so i killed seti on that too. i want to get some sort of heat extraction for my room. the window is open but its not helping much. my room is like an oven! the temp of the case is 12Deg C. i think my room is closer to about 20 or so! in one way its cool cause its warn, but its also too warm! need new fans, termal paste (more of it!) and a cooling system for the room! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
