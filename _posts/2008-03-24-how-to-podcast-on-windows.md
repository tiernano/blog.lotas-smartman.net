[ZefHemel has this blog post showing you howto Create Your Own Podcasting Show On Windows][1]. Its a little better then [this one i posted about before][2]. I still cant find my bloody microphone, which is a pain, but i have a cunning plan&#8230; I will try doing this with my Pocket PC, [Skype][3], and [Audacity][4] and see how that works. i will &#8220;Skype&#8221; my PC, which will record in Audacity and then turn that into an MP3. i might be able to play music with it, but at this point i dont know. might not be tonight. going somewhere, but lets try for tomorrow. wish me luck! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
