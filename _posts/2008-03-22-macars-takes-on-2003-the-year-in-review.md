Mac.Ars wraps up the year with a look back on all that transpired in Apple Land over the past year with an eye on possibilities in 2004 [[Ars Technica][1]] the biggest thing this year for apple, in my opinion, is the release of the G5. that just rocks. it just brings apple to a whole new level. if they release the [emac 2][2], it would make then even stronger!
