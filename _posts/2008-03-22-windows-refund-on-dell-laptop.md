Right. im looking at a [Dell Inspiorn 1100][1] laptop and it comes preinstalled with Windows XP home and Microsoft works. well, i dont want XP home and MS works. ill be getting this, formatting it and installing redhat 9.0 or the next one (10? 9.1? dont know what it will be called). I was on the phone to dell and they siad that i would probably get about 20 quid. thats pretty crap. windows xp home is on [komplett.ie][2] for [110 for the OEM edition][3], and [273 for the non OEM Edition][4]. now i understand that Dell did not pay 110 for the copy of XP, but technically i will when i buy the laptop. Also you get microsoft works with it. this is not very good. cant find a copy of this anywhere, so it will probaby worth nothing. but if i can get my money back, at least for XP, i would be happy. **[update]** here is the [how-to][5] on [windows refund.net][6]
