Ok. i dont know if this is a known issue, but hopefully someone knows. My XDA2s, which has been flashed with the latest i-mate PDA2k rom with Windows Media player 10 on it, will not sync play count with windows media player 10 on my PC. This is a bit of a pain when working with PodCasts. Anyone know of the problem?
