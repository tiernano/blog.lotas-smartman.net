Ok. for some strange reason my workstation rebooted about 4.45am this morning. Well just checking my log files and found out that at 4.46 there was a save dump. The description says: The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck. The bugcheck was: 0x0000007f (0x00000008, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000). Microsoft Windows 2000 [v15.2195]. A dump was saved in: C:\WINNT\Minidump\Mini050703-01.dmp. Hmmm. well it came back up, and no major damage was caused. just glad i found out what it was. now why did it cause a dump?
