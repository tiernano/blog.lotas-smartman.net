Well, not a total switcher, but close. i have a mac now, getting memory for it and a new cdrom drive and then im running OSX (pather probably) on it. getting panther will be my first major software purchase since office xp. also, im going to probably end up paying more on memory and the cdrom drive and software then i did on the machine its self! it cost me EUR110, and the memory is about as much! haha. madness!
