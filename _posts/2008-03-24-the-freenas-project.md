Check out the [FreeNAS][1] project. its a project that can help you easily turn that old junker of a PC into a NAS server. very handy stuff. i bought a small NAS drive a few days back and put a 300gb hdd in, but the problem is its using a FAT32 FS, so my max file size is 4Gb, so no copying of large tv shows&#8230; this could help though&#8230;
