[Virtual PC 5.2 for Windows Released; VMWare 4.0 Next Week &#8211; OSNews.com][1]. now that MS own Virtual PC, does that meen they will be removing Linux support, or making it work slower under Virtual Pc? im downloading the Trial of Virtual PC 5.1 now, and hopefully its upgradable to 5.2. looks neet and has some cool featers not in VMWare. I like vmware, but havent got it installed at the moment. maybe later.
