Check out [this for a workstation][1]. 4 processors, 8 cores, up to 32Gb of ram, and its a WORKSTATION. only one thing i can see a problem with. Windows XP x64 edition is being used on it. not thats there is anything wrong with that, but is there not a license restriction stating that it will work on 1-2 processors (which is 1-4 cores). which would mean that XP will only use 4 cores. either that or there is a way around this. i am not totally sure about the license difference between plain ol&#8217; win XP 32 bit and XP x64. anyone know? but this is one sweet machine!
