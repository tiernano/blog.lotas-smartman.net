Right. check out [this forum post][1] on how to make a diskless booting system with a [Gentoo][2] linux server. handy. now i wonder. will the processing be done on the server or diskless client? if i can get this working, i could borrow my mams hard drive, since she doesent use it that much, or wouldent need it after this, and i would have an extra 3gb hdd for playing with. then not only that, i could get my athlon 1.33gz working as a seti client again! wahoo! i think ill test this soon! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> also, check out [this one][3]: how to turn your box into an Xvnc Terminal Server. thats also handy.
