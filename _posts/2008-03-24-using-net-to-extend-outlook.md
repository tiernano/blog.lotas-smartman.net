[Robert Burke has this post on his blog][1] about extending outlook using .NET. some good links there. ideas are already forming. not going to say too much. i am working on a new idea. now that i found out how to install M[wordpress on IIS][2], i should now be able to not use apache and start using windows and .NET development for my main sites. which will allow me to play more with my server! more on that later.
