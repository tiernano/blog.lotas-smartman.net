[the register is reporting][1] that apple may be relasing a new tablet mac next month. they are also working on a lighter, cheaper imac casing, so prices for the imac (20in ocording to the article) will drop (probably) after this is released. Still no word on the [emac 2][2] which i talked about on November 22.
