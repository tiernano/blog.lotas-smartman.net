Im working on setting up an IPv6 network at home. this is going to consist mainly of my workstation, server and the VDS. my sisters machine is running win98 and im too lazy to set that up, and theres no reason to setup the parents machine. im getting info from [the gentoo IPv6 howto page.][1] handy info there. who else is running ipv6?
