<p mce_keep="true">I have been playing with this [ASP.NET MVC Framework][1] for the last few days, and i am very impressed! I am currently working on something, which, once its live, i will post more about. anyway, I decided a few days ago to build it around the ASP.NET MVC Framework, LINQ, ASP.NET 3.5 and AJax. I had a prototype originally written, and it used jQuery for the Javascript, so i have deicded to use this again.</p> <p mce_keep="true">Today, on Chad Myer&#8217;s Blog, he has info on [how to get ASP.NET MVC Framework talking to jQuery][2] (or the other way round if your so inclined&#8230;). Very cool. </p>
