Right then. i have come to the conclusion that Outlook XP hates me! i gets lots of email every day. i have over 30k emails sitting in different folders. i have Norton Antivirus 2003 and i also have Cloudmark AntiSpam installed. i usually have outlook open all the time cause it makes reading email easer. last night i was watching the F1 and it was slowing the system down so i stoped Outlook. I then forgot to open it again and when i got up this morning, i opened it and for the last 40 minutes its been sending and recieving email! 40 min to download about 500 emails! **40 MIN**! and thats not the worst of it! the server is localhost! i run my mail server at home and ÃÂ¬ts sitting on the same machine as outlook. The other thing is the fact that the machine that runs as a mail server also has 2 Athlon 2Gz CPUs. This is just anoying! Anyone know any tips? its a 7200RPM hdd with 8mb cache, so thats not a bottleneck, i dont think. Hmmm. talk about annoying! [update] found out why outlook is so slow. there are 37000 fragments of the outlook pst file, so im guessing thats the problem. 2 min after posting, i decided to check for a defrag. the report told me to defrag, so i am! So, woops!
