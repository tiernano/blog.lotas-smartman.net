Right. as you may have noticed, i moved from [MovableType][1] to [WordPress][2] over the weekend. The reason? well, firstly i though movable type died on me, but then when i realised it dident, i kept WordPress cause it seems faster. A LOT FASTER! Because WordPress is written in [PHP][3], it loads a lot quicker. and its easer to modify the page too. With MT, you have to rebuild the whole site when you modify one little thing. with WordPress, you dont. its done automagiclly! Its also got a few extra things that MT doesent have. I just seems a lot nicer. Anyway, to install WordPress, all i did was download it from the wordpress site, unzip it (dident have to upload, already on the server) and then configure it. once it was configed, i then just exported all the movabletype entries into a text file, told a script on the wordpress admin page (import-mt.php, in the wp-admin folder) where the importable file was, and that was it. a few seconds later, it was done! just some modifications to the front end (not a lot, but working on some more soon) and it was finished! the page was up and running. Now there was some mess ups with the old blog. i think i fixed some of them. hopefully, the whoile thing will transfer over OK. Any problem? just leave a comment, if they work yet&#8230;
