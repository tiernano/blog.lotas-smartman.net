I think i am replacing my current FTP client, [FileZilla][1], with a newer, cooler one, [SmartFTP 2.0][2]. This has a lot of the features of FileZilla, and more. very cool stuff! Coolest part of all, its free, and it has a full on x64 edition! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
