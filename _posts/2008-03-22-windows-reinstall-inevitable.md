Im not looking forward to this weekend! im going to have to reinstall Windows XP. The system has gotten quite slow over the last while, and the hard drive is full of, well, crap! So, a reinstall is due. So, im going to be doing a lot of backup to DVD, my second major format of the 120Gb hdd, and its just probably going to take a while. Visual Studio 6, 2002 and 2003 are going to be installed, i have to backup longhorn Virtual PC for more testing, etc. so. more info later.
