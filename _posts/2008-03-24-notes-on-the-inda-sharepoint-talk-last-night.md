So last night Mark Andrews (who doesn&#8217;t have a blog yet, but i am trying to solve that&#8230;) and myself presented to [INDA][1] on [SharePoint Portal Server 2003][2]. [Paschal has a post here about the SharePoint Talk last night][3]. Here are some of the resources I referred to, or didn&#8217;t (as the case may be).</p> 

Links:

Web Parts Template for Visual Studio 2003</p> 

</a>

[Office and SharePoint PDC Slides][4]

[SharePoint home page][5]

[SharePoint Developer center][6]

[SharePoint SDK][7]

[How to Buy (Prices in US)][8]

[Try out Windows SharePoint Services, free for a month][9].

[TechNet Virtual Lab: Microsoft Office SharePoint Portal Server 2003][10]

[Windows SharePoint Services Demo][11]

[Windows SharePoint Portal Server 2003&nbsp;Demo][12]</p> 

For Further info about Microsoft in Ireland check out the <a title=http://www.microsoft.com/Ireland href="http://www.microsoft.com/Ireland">Microsoft Ireland Home Page</a>

Command to add a new web part to SharePoint:

<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>**stsadm &#8211;o addwppack &#8211;filename *****<cabfilename> **</p> 

</i></p> 

This should be in your **%programfiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\60\bin **directory. I have added it to my path to make life easer in the demo.
