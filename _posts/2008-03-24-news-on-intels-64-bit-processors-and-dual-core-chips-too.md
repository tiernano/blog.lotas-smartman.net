[the register has some info][1] about the new intel P4 64 bit chips and news on their dual core chips too. The 64 bit chips are due out by 20th Febuary and their dual core chips will be dubed the &#8220;8xx&#8221; series. the 64 bit ver will come with 2mb cache, as well as 64 bit support. they mention that the dual core chips will run from 3Gz to 3.6Gz, but is that total speed, as in 2 1.5Gz or 1.8Gz cores, or is it 2 3Gz or 3.6Gz cores? I still dont know yet! drop me a comment if you know, since they are working again! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
