The Windows Live guys have released [Application Based Storage][1], a service for storage small amounts of data, eg application settings, in the Windows Live cloud. An example, i can think of off hand is Mail server settings. as long as you own the machine and it knows your Windows Live ID, it could download your mail server settings to the machine (assuming you have multiple mail accounts, like i do). Pretty cool stuff, and there is an [SDK for using this with your own apps][2]. [Via [Gregs cool [Insert Clever Name] of the Day][3]]
