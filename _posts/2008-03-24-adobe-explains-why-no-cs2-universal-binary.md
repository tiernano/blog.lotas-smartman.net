Check out this [post on the adobe blog][1], which i only found out existed, explaing why there wont be a universal binary version of Photoshop CS2. interesting read. aslo insteresting is the fact that they actually say they use Vistual Studio for their development environment on Windows! Cool! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
