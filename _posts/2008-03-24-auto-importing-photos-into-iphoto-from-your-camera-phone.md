Ok. i posted this before, but it was ages ago, and i havent used it since. but check out [this link i posted back in november 2004][1] about how to import photos from your camera phone into iPhoto. basically, when you send a photo from your phone, via bluetooth, you can tell your computer to automaticly import said photo, or multiple photos in some cases, into iphoto for later use. this is very handy! Check it out!
