<a href=\"http://www.electricnews.net/frontpage/news-9405305.html\">enn is reporting that Microsoft has unvailed XNA to developers</a>. XNA is a pretty cool sounding technolody. you develop your games using XNA and they will play (in theory) on a windows box, XBox, or Mobile device, that has XNA enabled. the idea of XBox and PC games being developed with one code base sounds pretty cool, but with the power of mobile devices, i cant see it being that easy! Still, sounds cool.
