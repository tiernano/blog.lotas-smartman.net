[Copy ASP.NET project to another PC][1]. this post from [Google groups beta][2] has info (well, links) on how to copy an ASP.NET project to an other computer for working on there. wonder can it sync with each other? i could be getting a laptop soon (no bets on it though) and it could be cool for working on projects from home/work on different machines. Hmmm.
