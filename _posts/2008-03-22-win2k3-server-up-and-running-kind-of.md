Right. I got my server running win2k3 server, but im still working on getting it to act as a domain controler. and i cant talk to it over the network either. i can ping it, but thats it. it can ping internal and external sites, but it cant get access to the Squid proxy, so no net access for it. all settings are correct, so i dont know whats going on. You can see it booting [here][1]. Once its runing, i hope to get [Exchange 2003][2] and [ISA Server 2004 BETA][3] working on it. Lets hope it works&#8230;
