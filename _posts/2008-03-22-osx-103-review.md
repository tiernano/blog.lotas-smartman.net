[Ars Technica][1] has a review of OSX 10.3 Panther. They also has a back catalog of reviews from [10.0][2], [10.1][3] and [10.2][4]. The 10.3 review is [here][5]. Just reading the old reviews to get up to date. i know this is quite a long time since 10.0 came out first (review is dated 4 feb 2001) but i may as well. check them out.
