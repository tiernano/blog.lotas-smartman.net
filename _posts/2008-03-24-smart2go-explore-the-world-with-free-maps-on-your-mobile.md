Nokia&nbsp;will (or has, depending on when your reading)&nbsp;release a&nbsp;a new app, [smart2go][1], tomorrow (Saturday, 10 Feb) which is a big Sat Nav system for mobiles. It works on some different platforms (selected Nokia S60 and **Windows Mobile 5.0** devices initially and has plans to roll out support for most of the major mobile OS platforms including Nokia S60, Series 40, **PocketPC**, Linux and **other Windows Mobile devices**). This is cool! I have my calander set to check the site in the morning, because i want to download this and see how well it works! and best of all: Its FREE! hopefully they have coverage of Ireland&#8230; [Via [MSMobiles][2]]
