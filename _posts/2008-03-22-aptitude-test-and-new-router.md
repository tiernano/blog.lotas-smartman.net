Right. I get my router tomorrow, which will be nice, and I also have an aptitude test with [FAS.][1] The course I&#8217;m hoping to get into in FAS is a [Software Developer Traineeship][2]. I hope I get it! So, talk to you after it. Probably going to bed early to get a head start and rest my brain! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> ill set up the router in the morning when i get back from FAS and ill probably have as little downtime as posbile. ill set the router up, with the MAC address of the net card my modem will only talk to, set up all the settings, port forwarding and the like, and then install the new firmware, if it doesent have the latest. Then ill unplug the modem from the current gateway system and plug it into the router, and hope for the best! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
