  * [Computer mod: the iMike][1]
  * [SCO Shows code][2]
  * [Hotmail Vulnerability allows spam][3]

off all the above, i have noticed a lot more spam comming from hotmail. i have also noticed that a lot of returns from the hotmail servers are comming into my hotmail box. stuff like this message cannot be sent. its weird. hope they fix it or all hotmail servers are going to have to be blocked! not good when 80% of your friends are using hotmail!
