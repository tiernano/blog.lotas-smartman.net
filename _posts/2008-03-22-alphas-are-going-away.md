[HP Are releaseing the last of the Alpha CPUs][1]. the last one will be 2004. pity. the first 64bit CPU that ran windows nativly. NT was 64bit alpha compatable, and for that matter 3.51 could have been. i still have a copy of NT4 workstation for the Alpha, i386 and i think space for that matter? no, mips sorry. anyway, i never owned one, but its sad to see it go.
