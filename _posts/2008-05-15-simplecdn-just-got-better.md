Any file between 0 and 1mb was charged 1 credit, which works out roughly at $1 (unless you buy in bulk). Well, today i was uploading some files for testing, and noticed i was only getting charged 0.1 credit for small files. I though it might have been a bug, but after checking their [pricing page][3], its correct! files under 100k are now only charged 0.1 credit! concidering 90% (if not greater) of the images on my Image Hosting site are under that size, i am starting to look into using them as my CDN! now to work out how to automate the upload from C#&#8230;
