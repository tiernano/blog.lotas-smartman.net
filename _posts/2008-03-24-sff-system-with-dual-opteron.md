[Hexus.net][1] has a review of a dual processor SFF system. this could be so cool, but also a pain in the ass. yea, dual processors of that speed in a system that small is cool, especially for clusters or the like, but you are going to be limited to the amount of drives in a single system. i supose you can get 400gb drives, so that could solve your problem, but man. still pretty cool. i still want a dual Opteron!
