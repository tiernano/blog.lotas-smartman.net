So, i was at a Camera confrence, Focus on Photograpy, in Birmingham, UK, today, and i bought my self a new Digital SLR Camera: The Canon EOS 350D. Very cool camera, and more about that later. I have also recieved the RAM and the 2 Opteron processors for the new workstation, which is comming, hopefully, tomorrow. More on that then too. Im off to bed. dident get a lot of sleep last night, and was up extreamly early (who knew you had to be up at 3.30AM to catch a 6.25AM flight!), so i need sleep.
