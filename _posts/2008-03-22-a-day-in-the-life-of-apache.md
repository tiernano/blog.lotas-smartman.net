[A Day in the Life of #Apache][1] by Rich Bowen &#8212; Rich Bowen, coauthor of Apache Cookbook, spends a lot of time on IRC fielding Apache questions. In this inaugural article to launch a new series based on his conversations on #apache, the IRC channel that runs on the irc.freenode.net network, Rich chronicles a user&#8217;s troubles getting his .htaccess file working, and he shows what you can do to solve the problem. 

interesting. i was having a problem with this .htaccess before too. this is a handy idea. and the idea of writing up stuff from an irc channel is quite handy too.
