[Enn are reporting that][1]smart telecom and Cork county council have just unvailed a new wifi network, which spans 1.5Km Squared. pretty cool. 512k/128k internet access, which is free to start, but charging will start soon. i wonder if this will happen in Dublin. that could be pretty sweet. it would have to be cheap though&#8230;
