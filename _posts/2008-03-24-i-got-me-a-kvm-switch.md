Wahoo! I just got my self a KVM Switch. only one problem. its a bit weird. i think the max resolution that this thing can do with out screwing up the screen is about 800X600. since my workstation is set at 1280X1024, theres is a little screen problem with it. theres a shadow on it. its a bit bit weird, but it works great. its pluged into the alpha server, my win2k3 server, my workstation and my soon to be win2k server. currently doing some network modifications (getting the win2k3 server acting as a domain controler, new domain, etc). photos later. network is working well now though! I will be moving sites internally soon, hopefully. watch this space&#8230;
