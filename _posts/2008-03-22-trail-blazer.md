<a href=\"http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/31/0513245\">Slashdot are reporting on a peice of software called trail blazer</a>. <a href=\"http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/macwarriors/projects/trailblazer\">Trail blazer</a> is a web browser for mac osx 10.3 which remembers where you where, how you got there and creates thumbnails and maps to sites you where. it looks pretty cool. theres a video which you can have a look at too. cant wait to get home and try this out on my mac. hopefully someone will impliment this in other browsers. it would be sweet!
