I meant to post about this before yesterday to see if anyone was interested in going, but i forgot all about it with [Thursdays happenings][1]. Anyway, yesterday there was a [Developers.ie][2] meetup with a talk from [Daniel Moth][3] on the [Compact Framework 2.0][4]. Its was a great night, and the talk was excellent. afterwards there was a Wine and Cheese experiance, which was pretty cool too!&nbsp;There is also a suprise talk on the [5th of August by Roy Osherove on Agile Development][5]. Which is pretty cool. And, some time around that date, there will be another announcement from me, but i wont say anything till then. So, anyway, Great night last night. i made an audio recording and both that and the slides and any code should be on [developers.ie][2] soon.
