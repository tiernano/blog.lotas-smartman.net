I dont have an actual use for this, and im probably short on &#8220;spare&#8221; machines, but this is a cool thing to do with a load of spare machines, and is one way to heat your room in the winter! check out this [ExtreamTech article on how to build your own Render Farm][1]. very cool stuff! (or warm if you want it as a heating unit&#8230;)
