Now this is cool! Cray and Microsoft have announced the [Cray CX1 Supercomputer][1], which is a really tiny (7U) super computer for use by, well, anyone who can afford it. Starting price is about $25k, going to upwards of $60k. the enclosure takes 8 "blades". you can mix and match these blades. There are 2 types of compute blades (single or dual socket, dual or quad core Xeons, upto 32Gb ram and storage), 2 storage blades (one 2 wide, holding 4 disks, 2 CPUs (again dual or quad core) and upto 32gb of ram, the other 3 wide, holding the same but with upto 8 disks). then there is a "Visualization" blade, which has same type of processor, memory and storage options of the compute blades, but with a high end graphics card and being 2 units wide. so, you can mix and match! the reason Microsoft are in on this? [Windows Compute Cluster Edition][2]. I want one of these for my house! i can see this being handy for a lot of things! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
