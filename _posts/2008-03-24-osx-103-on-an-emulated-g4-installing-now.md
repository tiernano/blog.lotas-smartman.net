Ok. I finally figured out how to make images of OSX 10.3 using [this tutorial][1]. So, i made the images of 10.3 panther, and i made a 6Gb hard drive image, which is being partitioned now. screen shots once its up and running fully will be posted somewhere. i might also find some benchmark software for the mac and see how fast my emulated G4 is agenst my real G3.
