Offering a set of tools (working together or independently) and integration with others open source projects, Castle helps you get more done with less code. 

[Borrowed directly from the [Castle project homepage][1]] 

This is looking interesting. one thing i want to try out is MonoRail:

MonoRail is a MVC framework inspired by ActionPack, a paradigm shift to simplicity.

I have played with the [Action Pack][6], and its interesting, but there seems to be some more interesting stuff in this MonoRail. I am defiantly playing with this over the weekend! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
