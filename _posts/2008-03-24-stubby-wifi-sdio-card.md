Engadget has some [info about a Stubby Wifi SDIO Card][1]. This could be cool. my Smartphone has an SDIO slot, but the standard wifi adapters are a little too big. they stick out too much. now this would be cool. it still sticks out a bit, but not that much. I wonders will there be drivers for the Smartphone&#8230;
