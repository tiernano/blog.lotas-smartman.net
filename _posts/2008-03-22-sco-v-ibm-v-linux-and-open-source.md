[this osnews][1] article has some interesting questions about [SCO V IBM][2] suite. there is quite a lot of questions asked, and the [comments][3] are quite interesting. im just after moving a futher 25% of my network (1 machine, but theres only 4 so 25%!) to linux. now my workstation and server run it and my mother would like linux on her machine too. anyway, i hope linux comes out the better of this. Or IBM. or who ever!
