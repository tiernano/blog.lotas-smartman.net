[Mac OS X 10.3.5 released; Apple releases new security update, new build of tiger][1]. I have to get a proper mac keyboard for my, well, mac, since i droped it a few months back and havent played with it in a long time. though, if [PearPC][2] becomes faster, does work well with G4 support, etc, i could get rid of my mac, in theory. since my mac is only 333Mhz G3 and the virtual one could be a G4, it would be a lot cooler. i dont know. im still half asleep. but yea. if you have a mac, get this update.
