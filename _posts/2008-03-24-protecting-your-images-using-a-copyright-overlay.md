Very interesting article over at Code Project.com showing you [how to overlay a copyright notice over your images][1]. this is a handy thing. i dont think i like the idea of big letters over the center of the image, but having a copyright notice at the bottom makes more sense. now my next question: how do i generate that image dynamically, so i could pull meta data, keywords, date taken, etc, out of a DB and display it dynamically (well, the over lay generated on upload, placed over the original, and then the new image placed on the server&#8230;)
