[Monoppix 1.0 has been released][1]. Its based around [Knoppix][2]&nbsp;but includes [Mono][3]&nbsp;so you can develop apps in C# and see what mono is like. It actually comes with an ASP.NET web server and MySQL, and also some Quick starts and guides for mono. i have to try this out, just to play with C# on Linux. Pretty cool!
