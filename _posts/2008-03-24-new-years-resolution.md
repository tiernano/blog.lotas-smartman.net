Ok. its taken a few hours, but here is it. my new years resolution: get more done. What do i mean? well, i have ideas, lots of ideas. some stupid and useless to people other then me and maybe 2 others in the world. other ideas could be usefull to loads of people, but because i dont work as hard on these ideas as i probably should, i dont get it done. So, i have started on a project, which i still need a name for, and i will have a beta or pre alpha anyway, on the web in the next few days. wish me luck! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
