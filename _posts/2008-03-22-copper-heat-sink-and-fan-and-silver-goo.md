Im being told by different people to get silver goo and either that fan i mentioned before [The Aero 7+][1], which [Peats][2] have for 45EUR, or a fully copper one. Hmmmm. i was also advised to get silver paste. hmmmm. interesting. i think ill be getting both, the goo and the copper heat sink. [**update**] that cooler, the aero 7+, is actually a copper cooler! best of both worlds!!!
