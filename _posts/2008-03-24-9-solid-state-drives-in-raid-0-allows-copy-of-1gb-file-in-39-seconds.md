Yep, 3.9 seconds to copy a 1Gb folder. That&#8217;s quick. The guys over at Next Level Hardware have shown the most almightily reason to buy [9 16Gb SSD drives and tie them together with RAID 0][1]. some interesting numbers: Vista Boot Time of 10.9 seconds! Vista Shutdown time of 5.4 seconds. Sustained Read performance of 828MB/s and access time of 0.1ms.

Makes me kind of sad to think that I only have 4 drive bays in my Mac Pro, but makes me wonder about External storage, faster larger SSD drive (just think if we could get 64 or 128Gb models this fast) and using more of them (16 instead of &#8220;just&#8221; 9). \*drool\*
