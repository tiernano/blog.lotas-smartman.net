[Nearly Free Speech.com][1], my current web host, had a database malfunction this morning. this caused some downtime. well i think it was this morning. it could have been yesterday. anyway, my site was down for a while. sorry about that. Also, in related news, i am concidering building a dedicated machine at home for the site. i have a AMD Duron 700Mhz with 384mb ram and 30gb hdd. i will probably install windows 2003 server on to it, and try and get my site working on there. i can then use ISA as the firewall again and leave my workstation acting as the Media center and a dev box too. anyway, thats to be done over this weekend probably, so more about that later.
