<p mce_keep="true">So, for nearly as long as i have had this blog, i have been running <a class href="http://www.communityserver.org/" mce_href="http://www.communityserver.org">Community Server</a> (well, .TEXT first, then Community Server). Now, dont get me wrong, i Love Community Server, but on the hardware i am currently running, i need something a bit faster and lighter. I also would very much like to get my hands on the code for tweeking bits and peices.</p> <p mce_keep="true">So, there are currently 2 contenders that may get the blog: <a class href="http://dasblog.info/" mce_href="http://dasblog.info">DasBlog</a> and <a class href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/" mce_href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/">BlogEngine.NET</a>. The only thing stopping me, or at least slowing me down, is getting my blog posts and comments out of Community Server and into either of the 2 contenders. What i may end up doing is taking a snapshot of the data, magically get it into both DasBloge and BlogEngine, and see which one works the best, which is faster, do some load testing, etc, and make my desicion. </p>
