I have finally recived all the parts for my [Dual Opteron SFF (Small Form Factor) workstation][1]. 2Gb ram, 2x2Gz Opteron processors, 300Gb hdd (currently only 5200RPM, but working on getting 7200RPM soon), DVD Rom drive (working on CDR/DVDR soon too) and an NVidia GeForce 6600 Graphics card, 8X AGP with 256mb ram. Very cool stuff! photos to come soon! I currently have the x64 version of the Feburary CTP build of Windows Vista, and so far so good. no problems with drivers, and everything is nice and fast!
