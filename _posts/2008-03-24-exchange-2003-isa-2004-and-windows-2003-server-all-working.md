Finally after reading a lot of websites and Exhcnage books (well 1 book and 2 ebooks) i finally got my Active Directory Domain Working and added my workstation to it. I also got Exchange 2003 Installed and working too, and accepting email for my network! now to get a spam killer and virus killer plugin to Exchange. I also installed ISA 2004 today, so i could get my sites running internally again soon. Watch this space!
