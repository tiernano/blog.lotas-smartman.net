right, i have heard of cooling PCs with oil. and from what i can gather, its quite simple as the oil is non conductive. only problem with doing it with vegetable oil is that it goes off, and then starts to stink. So, check out this idea: [Mineral oil cooled computer][1]. This is quite interesting, and also mad. Looks cool, dont get me wrong, but one point they made is &#8220;the oil effectively cools system components for up to 12 hours at peak load&#8221;. What happens after 12 hours at peak load? Does it deep fry your motherboard and components?! heh, i can just imagine: 

Friend: Hmmmm. is that <insert something deep fried here> i smell cooking?  
You: No, thats my computer.   
Friend: Strange&#8230;
