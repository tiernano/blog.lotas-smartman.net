check out this site with info on how to [make a CD that will allow you to install Windows XP on nearly any machine][1]. very interesting idea. now if only there was one of these for Windows XP X64 edition, Windows Media Center 2005,&nbsp;and Windows 2003 Server (both x64 and x86 editions) i would be even happier! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> [via [Download Squad][2]]
