[Engadget are reporting that][1] Toshiba has made the worlds smallest feul cell. this could be cool. its only a matter of time before most new devices come with these. only thing is that i wonder how much its going to cost. like its all cool that a smartphone could last 2x or 3x longer then my current phone does on battery, but i dont want to have to go out and buy charge cells or feul for it every week or couple of days. interesting idea though&#8230;
