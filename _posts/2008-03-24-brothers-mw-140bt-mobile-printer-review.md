[Brother&#8217;s MW-140BT Mobile Printer Review][1]. Interesting. a mobile, bluetooth printer. now theres a question for ya. can you use a network printer over wifi with a pocket pc? That would make printing little things easer for me! [update] After posting, i went searching and found [print boy][2] for the PPC which will do it. [net print][3] is also one that could work, but for windows ce 2.0 or above. nothing about PPC 2003. [PocketLAN][4] will allow plain text printing, but i might want something a little better. Hmmm. Final option. [Active Print 3.0][5] which you need to sync over Active sync or an active ActiveSync connection to print though. Hmmmm. yea. now to look for something better.
