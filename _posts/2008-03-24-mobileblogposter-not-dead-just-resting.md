Right, so I haven&#8217;t really done a lot with [MobileBlogPoster][1] in a while (last release was 24th February!), but I am posting this to say it is not dead, its just resting. With one thing and another, I have been busy on a couple of things, and haven&#8217;t had a chance to properly work on the code. I am currently working on a new project (I know, finish the one your currently working on first!) and once I get a &#8220;Release&#8221; build of that, MobileBlogPoster will get the much needed work it deserves! It will defiantly be handy for writing rants to [AngryViking.net][2] once it running, so there is my motivation!

So, if you want to add a comment, new future suggestion, or download and try it out, Check out the [CodePlex site][1]!</p>
