[this report on the register][1] says that an undersea cable connecting the UK and France has been damages and is the reason for some downtime of the net last night for some ISP&#8217;s. NTL UK is one of the ISP&#8217;s havng problems, but i havent noticed anything. my net connection has been a bit slow for the last few days though, but im not thinking thats to blame. most of my traffic comes direct from the UK (London if im correct in my thinking) and then to either Europe or the US. most of my traffic i was getting was from the US and some from the UK so i dont think thats to blame. but it might&#8230;. **[update]** yeap! it may be something to do with it. [News.com][2] says it was a link between the US and Europe. not just UK and Europe. Hmmm. hope this gets fixed soon. i dont like slow net connections!
