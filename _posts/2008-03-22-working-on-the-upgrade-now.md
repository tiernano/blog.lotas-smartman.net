Right. the server may be down for a few minutes, but [Vmware][1] on my workstation will take over. its faster (2gz V the 700Mhz in the server now) and has more memory (512mb V 256mb). dont know when the server will be fully backup and running. dont even know when the VMWare box will be running yet. trying to get Virtual domains working. ill tell you when its over anyway.
