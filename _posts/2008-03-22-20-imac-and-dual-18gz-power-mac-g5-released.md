[a dual 1.8Gz PowerMac][1] and a [20&#8243; iMac][2] have been released by apple. If i where given a choise between the 2, i think i would spend the extra $299 and buy a dual 1.8Gz Powermac G5 insted of paying $2199 for an imac G4. yea, it has a 1.25Gz G4 and a 20&#8243; display, where as the power mac doesent have a monitor, but i can convert a normal 17&#8243; monitor to work with an apple. it my be sacralige and the [Apple displays][3] do look sweet, but it would do the job.
