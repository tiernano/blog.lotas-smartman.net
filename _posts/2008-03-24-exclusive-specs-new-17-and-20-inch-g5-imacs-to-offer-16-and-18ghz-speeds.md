I was out in PCWord there a couple of days ago, and i seen the Vaio they talk about in the article, and though to my self &#8220;that could be what they do with the G5 imac. that could be cool&#8221;. Then i though, maybe not, but if these reports are true, it would be cool. In other apple news, talk of a [Tablet Mac][2]. I wonder&#8230;
