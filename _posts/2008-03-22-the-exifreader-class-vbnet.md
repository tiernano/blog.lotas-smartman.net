[The Code Project &#8211; The ExifReader class &#8211; VB.NET][1]. cool. this is handy if your camera produces EXIF meta data properly. for some reason my phone producies a weird version thats non readable properly. ill try this and see if it works right. hopefully it will. not sure why i want it, but handy to have! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
