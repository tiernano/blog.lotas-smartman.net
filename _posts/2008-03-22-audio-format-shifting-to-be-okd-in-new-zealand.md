<a href=\"http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/04/03/22/233248.shtml?tid=126&tid=141&tid=188\">slashdot are reporting that Audio Format Shifting To Be OK\&#8217;d In New Zealand</a>. Basicly, making an MP3 of your (leagally owned) cd is OK. Burning it to a mix CD, copying it to your PDA, etc, are all legal. Its concidered fair use. wonder how fair the fair use law is in ireland&#8230;
