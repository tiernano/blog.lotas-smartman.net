[this slashdot writeup][1] talks about [Seti@home][2]&#8216;s [Bionic][3] client. What it will do is allow other universitys with out super computers to get seti&#8217;s 3million+ machines to do computational tasks for them. not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing. good thing if seti get money to help their project from colleges, bad thing if they start selling it to businesses and they are the only ones to make money from it. i dont mid donating my computers time to something usefull, but business work for noting is a bit silly.
