[Altivec support for the Pear PC][1]! how cool is that! in theory, an emulated mac on my workstation could be faster then my real mac (Workstation is a dual Athlon 2Gz and the real mac is a 333Mhz G3 iMac). Just making an image of Panther disc 1 and disc 2 for testing under this. this will rock if it works well!
