[This idea its quite a cool idea][1]. Basicly, an RSS feed of Torrents, which, with a special client, auto downloads the torrent, and starts downloading the stuff from the torrent and shares it. the interesting part i think is the fact that once you post to the site, it will be downloaded by everyone with in, lets say, 6 hours. after the first 30min or so, the user who owns the file (under the assumptsion of &#8220;legal&#8221; content) wont be uploading anything. this then means that their file is on the web, to anyone with a lot of bandwidth available. an other idea would be to allow certin files to have a max time to be shared, and after that time, they stop being shared and then finish. kind of like &#8220;time sensitive files&#8221;.
