[The unofficial apple weblog has info about][1] getting your mac mini to use a 3.5&#8243; hard drive, insted of the standard laptop (2.5&#8243;) drive. very cool. saves you a lot too, since a 7200 RPM pc drive will set you back about 100EUR for 80Gb (probably less) but a 7200RPM laptop drives tops out at 60Gb (or at least i can only find 60Gb ones) and will set you back 140EUR. you can get 200Gb desktop drives for that price!
