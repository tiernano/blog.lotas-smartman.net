Apple today has released the replacment to the iBook, the [MacBook][1]. this is the baby brother of the [MacBook Pro][2]. couple of interesting things: 

1) available in black, but will cost you an extra $200, but they will pop in a 80Gb hdd insted of the standard 60Gb (so black paint cost $180 now?). 

2) dont think it will run [Apetrue][3]. the Graphics card in it is not listed as compatible on the [Apeture site][4], and its the same on as is in the <a>Mac Mini</a>. 

3) 13.3&#8243; wide screen. Interesting. 

4) 1.83 and 2Gz Core Duos (no Solos). 

Also, the <a>MacBook Pros</a> got an upgrade. the 1.83Gz is gone and now a 2Gz is in its place. the original 2Gz is now 2.13Gz. 12&#8243; powerbook has disappeared from apples site, which is interesting. 12&#8243; MacBook Pro&nbsp;on its way?
