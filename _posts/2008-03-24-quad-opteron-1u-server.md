Ok, this is one hell of a dence server setup. [You can now stick 4, dual core Opteron processors into a 1U server rack][1]! thats 8 processors per 1.75&#8243; of server space. by my calculations thats 336 processors in your average 42 unit rack! hmmmmm. sweet! mind you, it will require 42KWatts of power to run, but that is cool still. a few of these bad boys in&nbsp;my bedroom data center would definatly be nice!
