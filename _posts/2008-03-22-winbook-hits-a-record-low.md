[WinBook Hits a Record Low Price][1]. Your money can now go farther with the $799 WinBook J4 731 value notebook. [[Fresh Reviews from PC Magazine][2]] Seen this thing before. looks pretty sweet. pitty now i have to pay a futher 21% (i think) VAT on top of that. well im not sure the %, but i have to pay VAT on it anyway. still works out at $966. not bad.
