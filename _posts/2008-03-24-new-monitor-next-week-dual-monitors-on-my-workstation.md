So, i am getting a new monitor next Saturday. a nice 17&#8243; flat panel, because i can and because my old one is going strange. So, as a pre-cursor to the upgrade of the second monitor, i have put in a second video card into my system and gotten a pretty crap VGA monitor working with it. This was just a really crap monitor i had lying around. i got an 8mb PCI graphics card and everything is working grand now. So, its pretty cool. photos when i get the new display later in the week.
