After nearly 3 years of service, my Mac Pro has left the building&#8230; well, not literally, it’s still on the desk, but it won’t boot no more&#8230; RIP my old (but sometimes annoying friend)&#8230;

Since the machine is now dead, i have started to look at my next workstation&#8230; which i hope to have running by September for College&#8230; (more on that later)

Some options:

· New [New MacPro][1]: though i am thinking i don’t want to buy a Mac again, since i can’t really upgrade it (other than memory or HDD). The graphics are Mac Only (PC cards wont work) and there are only 4 drive bays for HDDs anyway&#8230; 

· [Dell Precision workstation][2]: this is not a cheap option! Configured with just 2 2.66Gz Quad Core Xeons, this is just under 4 grand, BEFORE TAX!!! And i haven’t even done anything else!

· DIM (Do it MySelf&#8230;): this means finding a Dual Xeon Motherboard (since i have the processors and ram already). A good mobo should have enough ram slots (8 would be ideal), enough SATA slots (minimum of 6, more is better) and at least 2 x16 PCI Express 2 slots&#8230;

· DIM option 2&#8230; get a nice server Dual Xeon mobo, take the current ram and procs from the old MacPro and turn that into a server (don’t matter much about graphics in those&#8230;). then, get a new Nehalem dual proc board, which i have found one for about 350EUR, 2 Nehalem processors (not sure how much these are&#8230; ) and some DDR3 memory&#8230; add in a good graphics card or 2 and your laughing&#8230; maybe even water cool the machine&#8230; could be cheaper than the Dell&#8230;

Any thoughts? Should i just go Core i7 instead?
