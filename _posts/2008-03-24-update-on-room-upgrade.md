Ok. my workstation is back online, so is the router, but the servers are now officially off line for a while. Ill hopefully get them back tomorrow some time. My room is still in a state! there will be photos! I have a few. this room now has 26 sockets (we broke a socket set so thats why its down from 28) and there are now more in my room alone then anywhere in the rest of the house! also, it has its own circut from the main fuse box! all downstairs sockets (except the cooker) and all upstairs sockets have one each, and then theres my room! wahoo! anyway, [the-hairy-one.com][1] is back. i forgot i had it running on my host ages ago! anyway, better start cleaning my room!
