Right. found 2 places doing simular stuff. the first one i found was [Penny Arcades&#8217; Child play][1]. they are looking for games, toys, computer stuff, etc for childrens hospitals in Seattle. then theres the irish one. [The Boards.ie Santa Strike Force][2] is doing a simular thing. so, ill probably be helping the irish one since its irish and stuff. check them out. and give as much as posible.
