[this article over at neowin][1] talks about how[BMG album copy protection is thwarted with the shift key.][2] not only the shift key, but vmware, linux and anyone who doesent have auto run enabled. i had VMware installed on my machine and one of the things it does is remove autorun because it messes with the Virtual machine. linux does not have windows autorun either so that can get around this. pretty funny.
