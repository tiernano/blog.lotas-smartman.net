Just in from O&#8217;Reilly Developer News.. Virginia Tech is upgrading its supercomputer to G5s. [[O&#8217;Reilly MacDevCenter.com][1]] wonder will they get more machine in the same space? like the current G5s that are in there are quite packed in. maybe if they add more, they can become number 2?
