[this article over at Informit][1] has info and code snippits on how to use Multithreading in the .NET Framework. Very interesting read. I have been playing with Multithreading in VB.NET and its very handy. So far i have managed to build a stupid little app with 3 threads and it takes 100% of the CPU time on my home box, which is dual athlon. now to get it doing something more usefull then just counting!
