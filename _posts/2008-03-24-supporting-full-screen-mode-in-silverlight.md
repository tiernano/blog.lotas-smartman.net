  SilverLight is one of those technologies i can&#8217;t wait to start playing with (Unfortunately, i have had to wait, but the wait should be over later tonight. More about that later). Anyway, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/default.aspx">ScottGu</a> has had some cool posts over the last while showing you how to do different things in SilverLight, and the latest tip/trick is <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/17/tip-trick-supporting-full-screen-mode-with-silverlight.aspx">full screen support</a>. Now, this is very cool! Now, hopefully, i will post why i hope the wait is over later tonight! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
