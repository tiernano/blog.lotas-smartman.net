[Slashdot | Turbolinux Licenses Windows Media 9][1]. thats handy. when i was playing with linux i never managed to get my linux box to play a DVD, had trouble playing some meida typed (mp3s had no problem!) but now this would make life for a lot of linux users easer. but at $64 for just the codecs, its a bit expencive. wonder will it go down in price?
