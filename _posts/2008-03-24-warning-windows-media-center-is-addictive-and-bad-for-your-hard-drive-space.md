Well, its actually a good thing, even though the title sounds bad. i had a full format of my machine a couple of weeks ago, which left me with a nice clean 120Gb hdd (well, 112Gb after install of stuff). I currently have 11Gb free, and im off for the weekend. my guess is that by the time i come back on Sunday night, my drive space will again be gone!
