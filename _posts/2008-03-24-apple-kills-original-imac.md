Looks like OSX 10.4 (Tiger) has just put the final nail in the coffen of the original imac, and any other mac without a firewire port. [on the system requirements page][1] the original i mac, non slot loading, is not listed as compatible. also, the page says that you must have a firewire port. Hmmmm. pity. now my old iMac will either stay at 10.3, or become a linux box&#8230;
