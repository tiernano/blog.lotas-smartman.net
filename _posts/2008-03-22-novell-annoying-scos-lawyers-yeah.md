Novell has just said that SCO may not have a case as such. Quote from the register article:

*&#8220;Novell has launched another foray at the heart of The SCO Group&#8217;s case against IBM, the 1995 contract in which SCO says Novell gave it the rights to UNIXÃ¢.Â¢ and derivative works.*

*Without the contract, SCO is simply another UNIXÃ¢.Â¢ licensee and has no grounds to pursue its case against IBM, and by extension, Linux users everywhere. SCO is already retreating from its claims to ownership of AT&T&#8217;s System V, some rights to which subsequently fell into Novell&#8217;s hands, but which SCO insists fall under the 1995 agreement. This, SCO says, gives it the rights to control derivative works. But as a sub-sub-licensee, says Novell, SCO is hardly in a position to bully anyone. Who&#8217;s right? &#8220;*

need i say who i hope is right? [The article is here][1].
