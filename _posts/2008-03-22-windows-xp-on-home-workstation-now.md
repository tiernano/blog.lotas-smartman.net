Hmmmm. winxp was installed last night, as i stated in my last post, and it took all of 25min! installed the service pack this morning and it should be finished downloading other updates and stuff now. now all i have to do is finish installing patches, and install my bluetooth adapter, when i get home, if its there. this should be fun! ill post some pics of it, cause its going to be free to post them! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> Wahoo! i love bluetooth. i should, hopefully, be able to surf the net over bluetooth on my phone. if i can then i can do other stuff. ill see what i can do anyway. ill post when i get home.
