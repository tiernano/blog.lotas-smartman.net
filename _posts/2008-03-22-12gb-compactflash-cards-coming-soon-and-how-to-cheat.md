They are talking about a 12Gb CF card thats going to cost a staggering $14,900! they also have links to how to take the CF microdrive out of the Muvo and get a 4Gb CF card for $200. i talked about removing the CF Card from a Muvo [here before][2]. pity none of my devices take CF cards or i could be getting a couple of gigs worth! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
