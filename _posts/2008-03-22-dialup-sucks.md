im currently posting this from my front room on a dial up connection. its not bad, but cant do anything great on it. i downloaded windows xp sp2 rc2 last night on a 100mb/s link and installing it now. you have to be on ac power before it lets you install it. makes sence. so. just sitting in the front room and messing around with the laptop watching the TV. ill have my wifi router on monday, so ill be posting photos and stuff. also on that day the new phone is arriving, actually in the same packaging! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> wahoo! anyway, more stuff later.
