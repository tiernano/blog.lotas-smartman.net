Just found my site doesent look well in IE5 on win98 with 1024*768 Resolution. Hmmmm. probably a problem with some of the posts. 2 of them showed up strange, though the rest worked fine. ill fix the way i post stuff. sorry for all you win98 and ie5 users. does this happen on other copies of IE5? like on win2k or win NT? i dont have a copy of it installed for testing, yet, but ill install it on [VMWare][1] fairly soon.
