<a href=\"http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/sipphone\_callinone\_voip\_on\_your\_regular\_phone.php\">This SIP and Standard phone router looks pretty cool</a> and has some good ideas. you plug your standard phone line into it, and your cat 5 connection in too, and a standard phone. when you pic the phone up, it acts as a normal phone, but hitting # makes it make a VoIP call to SIP. now, it sounds pretty cool. article says its about $90. sure sounds worth it!
