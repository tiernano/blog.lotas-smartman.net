Now, how cool is this: [An OLED keyboard][1]. Its only a concept, but it is absolutly amazing! The idea is that each key on the keyboard is a tiny little OLED screen. if you go to a new application that has key mapping, your keyboard keys change to show you (great for games i would think!). if you change your locale settings, your keyboard remaps its self too! It just looks briliant! i want one of these!
