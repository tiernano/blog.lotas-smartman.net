[MS-DOS net command help][1]. very handy tips. this is one of the things i did not know. i need to install an copy of windows at home on a machine with no cd drive. it has a floppy, so all i now need to do is share the cd rom drive with the windows cd in it, or i could create a slip streamed version of windows, and then install it over the network. I&#8217;m probably ment to know this stuff already, but windows does it automaticly, or fairly automaticly. so thats all i used before!
