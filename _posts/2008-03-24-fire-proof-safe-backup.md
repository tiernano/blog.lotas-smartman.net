check out this pretty cool article over at network garage showing you how to build a fireproof backup safe for storing your files in. very simple and brillent idea! get a fireproof safe with power, get a NAS Device and a hard drive, and hook the whole lot up in the locked safe. if anything goes wrong, your data is saved. interesting! [update] im such an idiot! i forgot the link, [here it is now][1].
