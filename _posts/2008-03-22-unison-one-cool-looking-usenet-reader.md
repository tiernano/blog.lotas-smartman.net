[just found this][1] MacOSX app, with help from [0xDECAFBAD][2]. Looks pretty sweet. have to install this on OSX when i get home, but it does look sweet from the screen shots. only thing is its not free. but from what is says it can do, im not too suprised there. its $25, or for $29 you can get news group access with them for one month with 10Gb transfer. looks pretty sweet, and im wondering would my mac be able to run this fast enough. i cant wait to get home!!!
