[Microsoft offers glimpse of Windows Server 2003 R2][1]. I can understand the naming convenstion of something like 2k3 server or XP to add second edition to them, but if tablet PC can get an upgrade with an SP and become XP table PC edition 2005, why couldent Windows Pocket PC Edition? Like Pocket PC 2003 Second edition would sound better is it was Pocket PC 2004. Hmmm. anyway, enough of that for now.
