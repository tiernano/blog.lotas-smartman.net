alright. i have managed to get some time to say happy christmas to you all. i got a playstation 2 for christmas with Grand Turismo 3 and Burnout 2. they are quite cool games. since the tv in my room decided to die this year, i have it hooked up to my PC via the TV card. this works well. last night i downloaded a copy of [Knoppix][1] and [White Box Enterprise Linux][2] (which is based on [RedHat Enterprise Linux][3]). So, im just burning them to CDs, backing up some stuff to DVD and im going to install Linux on my workstation again and WBEL on the server probably in the next few days.
