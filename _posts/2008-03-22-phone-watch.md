[Worlds first (probably) phone watch][1]. Check it out. quite cool looking. and the way it looks, your not talking to your watch. you take it off and make the call. looks pretty cool. display looks weird. not colour. its yellow with black text. article is in japanise, so i cant make sence of it! its 4cm thick, which by my calculation is a little thinker then my watch, it looks bulkey, but it would. its got a built in phone/PDA (by the looks of the screen shots). check it out. found the original post [here][2].
