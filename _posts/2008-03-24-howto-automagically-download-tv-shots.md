[this engadget howto shows you how to download TV shows automagically][1] using the power of RSS and Bit Torrent. i never tried anything like this because i though it would automatically download everything in the RSS feed, and there would be things i dident want, so i just did it manually before. but you can filter, and the howto shows you how. it is pretty cool, so i will be trying this out soon. PS: i dont condone this and i am only doing it becuase 1: i can, and 2: theres a few shows i cant get my hands on here in ireland because they are not broadcast.
