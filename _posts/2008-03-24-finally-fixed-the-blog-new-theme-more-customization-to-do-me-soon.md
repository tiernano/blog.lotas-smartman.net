So, as you can see, i have fixed the blog! it now runs Community Server 2.0 RTM. So far, so good. comments are now working again, which is handy, and i am using a new theme for the site. I will do some customization to the theme soon (or change it completly, depending on how creative i feel). Anyway, hopefully all goes well! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
