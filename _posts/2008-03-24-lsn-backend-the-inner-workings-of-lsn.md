i was kind of board so i build my [new backend site][1]. basicly stuff thats running the network. more photos will be added, eventually, so keep checking back. Its written in ASP.NET (my first live site on .NET!) and uses ASP.NET 2.0. Developed with Visual Studio Web Developer 2005 beta. More about that soon though.
