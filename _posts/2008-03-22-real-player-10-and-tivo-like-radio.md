I just installed [Real player 10][1] for windows on my machine in work, and im listening to [2FM][2] and i just realized i could rewind the radio. it records for what ever amount of time you have been listening, which can be modified (anywhere from 5 min to 12 hours) and it will record it all. then you can hit pause and be listening to a live stream from what ever many minutes ago. i though of this before, a [Tivo][3] for radio, but this actually works. its called PerfectPlay. wonder is 10 out for the mac or linux yet?
