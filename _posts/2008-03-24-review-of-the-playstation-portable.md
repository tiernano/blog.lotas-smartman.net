[[The Register][1] has a review][2] of the PlayStation Portable (PSP). Looks interesting. if i want one, it will need one or all of the following games: Gran Turismo, Burnout (any of the 3, but 3 would be a lot of fun), Grand Tefth Auto. I know Ridge Racer is available (photo in the review) so, that would also be sweet. Can you guess i like car games?
