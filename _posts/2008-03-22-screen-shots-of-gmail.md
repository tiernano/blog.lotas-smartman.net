<a href=\"http://fury.com/article/1990.php\">there are some screen shots of GMail here</a>. i found the post <a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/waynekao/archive/2004/04/04/107309.aspx\">here</a>. <a href=\"https://gmail.google.com\">Gmail</a> sounds really cool. wonder what kind of address you get? would it be you@google.com or you@gmail.com? or even you@gmail.google.com? [update] theres a bit more of a write up and more screen shots <a href=\"http://miscoranda.com/102\">here</a>, and you get a you@gmail.com email address. wonder when this will be released&#8230;
