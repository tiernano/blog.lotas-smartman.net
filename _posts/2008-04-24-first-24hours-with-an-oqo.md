So, yesterday i talked about the design of the [oqo][1], but i dident get a lot of time to play around with it properly, because 1: it needed to be charged for 24hours before i could unplug it, and 2, for some reason my Wireless network is acting up and it would no connect. Well, today, i am blogging with it! its very nice. screen is a bit small, but then again, so is the whole thing. it fits nicely into my pocket, and its all good.

touch screen works great. I cant wait to install [Office][2] and [OneNote][3] on this! i also have to install XP Tablet PC edition, since there&nbsp;is no built in support for the stylus and inking in XP Home.

So, so far so good. one pad point in the heat. Man this thing gets HOT! i left it running last night, installing updates, and when i picked it up, it was VERY VERY hot. i have been playing with the cooling srttings, so hopefully this will solve the issue, but we wait and see.
