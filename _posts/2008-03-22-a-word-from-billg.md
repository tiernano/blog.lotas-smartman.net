*[Via [Weblogs @ ASP.NET][1]]* now thats going to be well handy. hopefully updates to Visual studio, office, etc, will be there. also, hopefully it will work like the updates in XP SP2 where theres a little desktop app for updating stuff. i always forgot to check updates in Ofifce and stuff. silly me!
