Ok. its been a busy week for me, and a unbusy week for posting on the site. So, here are a few updates. 1: i got confirmation about telling you where i work: Microsoft. Im back in Microsoft, after being away for a little over 5 months (actually it was 5 months yeaterday when i left, 11 March). So, im happy with that! 2: i will be getting my exchange server up and running, hopefully, tomorrow. I hope it works as i havent checked my email in about 3 weeks or so now! finally, PodCast. I will try do one tomorrow, but with the way things have been going, i dont know if it will happen. I would do one know, but im up early in the morning, and im going to bed now. Good night and hopefully i will talk to you in the morning!
