[check outn the photos of the laptop!][1] actually still posting on this machine. just installed windows xp pro, have to install visual studio soon, and office too. really nice machine to work with. battery life is good. it estimates about 3 hours in total, and at the moment, connected to the web with a wired connection and with wifi and bluetooth radios on, it is entimating about 2 hours left. not bad. it says the battery is 64% full. its a pentium M chip, so battery is meant to be good. anyway, off to bed. its been a long week .
