I am going to start work on the LSDN when i get up tommorow/later on. its now just before 1am and im off to bed. i hope to have some sort of SSL support working, so login in and posting will be secure. not sure when the blogs will be ready, but hopefully it will be soon. ill start work and the write up for it tommorow. Tools of the job: Redhat Linux 9 as the OS, Apache 2 as the Web server, PHP 4.2 as the PHP Processor, MySQL as the Database and Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004 as the design software with Fireworks MX 2004 as the graphics. ohhh and probably Swish for Flash? Dont know aobut that one yet.
