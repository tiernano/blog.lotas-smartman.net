Typical problem for me to have, really. The workstation arived and it was LOUD! extreamly loud. loudest thing in my room! Well, today while checking the thermal paste on the CPUs (to make sure it was on correctly, and actually there) i realised that there was a plastic film over the 2 heat sinks. after removing the film the chips now run at 22-30DegC, compaired to between 45-55Deg C! stupid!
