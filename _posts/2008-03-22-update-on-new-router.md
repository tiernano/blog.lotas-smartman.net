I know i said i was getting me a 3com router, but after looking up info on the net, it doesnet support port forwarding and that would be needed. i have 3 servers and a workstation that needs opne ports on the internet, and the 3com only supports 1 DMZ host. So, now for the new one. is a Billion Broadband Gateway 10/100 Mbps BIPAC-640AE. Manafature site is [here][1]. Looks pretty cool. has full support for what i want, and does the job, hopefully! It will be here in the morning! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> i love [Komplett][2] and [DHL][3]!
