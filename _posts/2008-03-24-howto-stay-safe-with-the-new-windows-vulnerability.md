Ok, i have ready a bit about this over the last few days, but dident get a chance to post about it, but there is a new [Windows vulnerability in the Windows Graphics Rendering Engine][1]., which is bad, basically. [Adi Oltean has a work around on how to fix the problem][2]. Stay safe. For ease of use for users, here is a copy of the post:

*As previously published *<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/912840.mspx" target=_blank>*here*</a>*, this is a quick-and-dirty method to get yourself in a safe position: *<blockquote dir=ltr> 

*1) Click **Start**, click **Run**, type &#8220;**regsvr32 -u %windir%\system32\shimgvw.dll**&#8221; (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.  
2) Restart the machine. *</blockquote> 

***Impact of Workaround:** The Windows Picture and Fax Viewer will no longer be started when users click on a link to an image type that is associated with the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer. *

*To undo this change, re-register Shimgvw.dll by following the above steps. Replace the text in Step 1 with &#8220;**regsvr32 %windir%\system32\shimgvw.dll**&#8221; (without the quotation marks).*

*MSRC is *<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2005/12/30/416694.aspx" target=_blank>*fully aware*</a>* about this situation and it is working on a patch to be released in the next days. In the meantime, make sure that your Windows OS is configured for receiving automated updates, and that you have an&nbsp;antivirus program installed. *
