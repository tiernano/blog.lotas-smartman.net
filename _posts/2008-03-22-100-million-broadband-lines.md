[Enn is reporting][1] that there are currently 100 million broad band lines world wide. and of the 100million, ireland has 17850! thats 0.01% of the share. if [Eircom][2] droped the price of broadband and so did the other companies, i reckon we could get a lot more people connected. its a bit on the rediculous side that there is less then 0.5% of the population on broadband and about [50% of the population][3] are online. i think we could make that 50% are on broad band and 75% online. i blame eircom!
