I read about this [Astoria][1] before, and was very interested in what it could do. Its a Big REST enabled Database in the Sky, and up until recently, was not available for your own data. Well, the service is [now open for developers][2] to use their own data on, and this should make writing web based apps interesting. you get 100Mb of storage, and everything is returned in XML format by default, but the [tools page][3] also shows RDF and JSON as output support. Anyway, I can see this being very interesting, and something I will look into. I would like to modify my image hosting site to use this. could be interesting if it works!</p>
