[toms hardware has a review of Archos&#8217; AV 400][1], a 9 ounce PVR and TV. this thing is pretty cool. 20gb hdd, 10 hours MP3 playback and 3 hours video playback. it can act as a PVR so you can plug this into your TV and video, record stuff from the video, unplug it and bring it with you to watch on the bus! you can also play back stuff you recorded onto it on the TV. sweet little device. there will be an 80 and 100gb version soon, but at 900 euro for the 80gb, and 600 for the 20gb, its a little expence for me, but still a sweet system.
