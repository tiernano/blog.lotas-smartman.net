Do you have a Media Center PC (Vista Home Premium or Vista Ultimate)? Do you dislike ads? Check out [Lifextender][1]. This is probably the coolest free/donation ware i have found in, ohh, the last 20min (maybe even longer!). Anyway, it scans your MS-DVR files (the recorded TV shows from Media Center) detects where the ads start and finish, and deletes them! so all your left with is the TV show goodness! Nice! Currently in Alpha, but so far (at time of writing) it has removed 3 days, 18hours and 23min of ads from TV shows it has processed, which equates to about 7231 ads.
