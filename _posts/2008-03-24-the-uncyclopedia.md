[the uncyclopedia][1]. Interesting. Some weird things like [Japan][2]: Japaneseville is the town that is on the other side of the world, if you live in Amerika. It&#8217;s that one that isn&#8217;t China (or maybe it is&#8211;we aren&#8217;t too sure about that). If you live in China, it&#8217;s quite close. If you live in Japan, just look out of the window. (Japanese translation of this page Japan (in Japanese) available. Japanese is here, English is here. WONDERFUL FUN! BIG CRUNCH TIME? SUPER ELBOWS!)Batman doesn&#8217;t need super powers to beat superman
