Right. i have come to the conclusion that im going to upgrade the mac like i said [here][1], insted of buying a new one, like i said [here][2]. the reason? Price. i have spent close to EUR300 on the imac so far, and was told i would get about 200EUR for it as a trade in on an [Emac][3]. if i get the upgrade, i can keep the mac running as a nice machine if i do upgrade later.
