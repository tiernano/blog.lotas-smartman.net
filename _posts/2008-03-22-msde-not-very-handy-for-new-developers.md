Right. im learning to get MS VB to talk to an [Access][1] database and a [MSSQL Database][2]. I need a copy of SQL server on my machine, so i though that [MSDE][3], being based on SQL 2000, would be the best option for me. HOW WRONG I WAS! Im using the microsoft mastering series of books and CDs for my learning, and it tells you how to add data to the SQL Database. the options are not availabe in MSDE. i know MSDE is desinged for developers who want to use SQL for their apps, but i though it would at least come with some sort of admin feature! so im now downloading the [SQL 2000 Trial][4]. luckly it works on XP Pro!
