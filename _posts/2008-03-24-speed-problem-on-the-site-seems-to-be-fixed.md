Ok. the problem with speed of the site seems to have been fixed. i think this may have been a DNS issue. i had to reboot my win2k3 server because of a software update, and it took about 5 min to reboot, which isent bad because it usually takes it 30 because of exchange. anyway, when it came back up, it was taking a little time for all services and the like to start, so thats probably when DNS wasent working. its acting as a DNS Server for my network. anyway, i hope this is now fast. now to get my second win2k3 server up and running. i dont know when i will get a chance to do it, but i will have to eventually.
