I got 729 out of 1000 on [trancender][1] which [if this post is correct][2] is a pass. im getting better. the test is on 8th October. im getting ready. i still havent passed [transender][1], which needs 850 out of 1000. BTW, its the MCP 70-176 in VB6 desktop applications im doing now. wish me luck!
