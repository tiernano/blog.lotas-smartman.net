Ok. this server will be going down for about half an hour to an hour tomorrow. this is due to some, lets just call it maintance! getting extra plugs in my room for the extra equipment i have, making a comms closet, and some general cable tidying. hopefully it wont be down for too long. and after the event of last year (close to the actual day too), im going to be backing everything up! this blog, with its current posts, started after a server move last year. actually, i do remember. i was trying to move from <a href=\"http://radio.userland.com\">Radio Userland</a>, and couldent!
