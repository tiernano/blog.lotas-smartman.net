Ok, Gigabyte have gone nuts! [Tom has a review of a mobo with 4 PCI Express][1] slots, all capable of taking graphics cards. so, insted of thowing 2 graphics cards, each costing about 800EUR into your system, you can throw 4 of them in! And there are configs that will allow you to have all 4 GPUs doing stuff at the same time! I can think of a better solution: 4 graphics cards, each with twin DVI out, and 8 24&#8243; wide screen Dell monitors&#8230; SWEET! now if it could take 2 (or even 4) Dual core Opterons, i would be sold! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
