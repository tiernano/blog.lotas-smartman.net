There have been a couple of services popping up around the place allowing you to track fuel costs, etc, and it has gotten to a stage that its starting to annoy me. not because the services are there, but because of my own stupidity. Last July, I started coding my own Data Logging website for tracking Oil and Fuel consumption on my car, with the intent on making it available for public use. Well, the first checkin went in at 19.24 on the 22nd July 2007 and nothing major has happened since then&#8230;

![][1] 

Both the domains [MotorLoggr.com][2] and [MotorLoggr.net][3] (with both go nowhere at the moment) are registered as of the 21st July (There was some spec writing going on, but I knew the name before I started coding). 

Anyway, I am here to announce the return of the project, and I hope to have a demo and prototype working by the end of the month.

Some of the ideas that this will include will be secret for a while (mainly because I am not sure of what half of them will be&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> and also for &#8220;security&#8221;) but there will be web service access so tools can be written for phones, pocket PCs, desktop app&#8217;s, etc. If anyone has any suggestions, please leave a comment. 

PS: I would love to add a screen shot, but I am having problems with my internal network and I am not sure where my SQL box is&#8230;. Odd problem to have, I know, but hopefully i can fix it soon!
