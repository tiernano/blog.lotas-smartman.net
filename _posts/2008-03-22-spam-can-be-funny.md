I just got spamassassin and got it working properly last night. so far it has cought 7 spam messages. i dont usually get LOTS, but this is enough for about 10 hours. anyway, of the 7 spam messages, 2 where fast IDs, mainly because i droped my minimum to 2. probabably should fix that cause one of them was 2 exactly, and the other was 5.10, but i supose it was really half spam (yahoo groups with loads of crap on it). anyway, here are some of the results its gotten back!!! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
