i have just installed linux on my workstation. i got rid of windows fully and now linux is back. just downloading updates to linux at the moment. since i am on [gentoo][1] and updates are fairly regular, there are nearly 100 updated packages! im not complaining. these are important updates and its more then likely going to make my system faster!
