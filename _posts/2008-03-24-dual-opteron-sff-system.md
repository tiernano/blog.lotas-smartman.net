Check out [this review of the Iwill ZMAXdp][1] over at [SFF Tech.com][2]. The system is a Dual Opteron Small Form Factor System! Pretty damn cool! I&#8217;ll have one of those! Hell, you could have a server farm with them in the same space my machine takes up! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
