[iTunes now has 64bit Vista support!][1] this was something I batteled with for a while&#8230;.

![][2] 

[MacBookAir gets released][3]. Standard system comes with 1.6Gz Core 2 Duo, 2Gb ram, 80Gb PATA HDD, 13.3&#8243; display, 5 hour battery 802.11n wifi and Bluetooth 2.1 EDR. Options include 1.8Gz processor and 64Gb SSD storage. price? $1799 for the standard system, and $3098 for MacBook Air with 64Gb SSD and 1.8Gz processor.

Next is [Time Capsule][5]. Sounds like a bit of a copy of Windows Home Server. Sits on your network and backs up your Macs. Hmmm.&nbsp; Also acts as a Wireless Base Station. Comes with either 500Gb or 1Tb storage for $299 and $499.

The Apple TV got upgraded, which is just a software update. The price also fell to $229 and $329 for the 40 and 160Gb models. I have a 160Gb model at home.

One of the new features in iTunes is [Movie Rental and HD Movies][7].
