<a href=\"http://www.aci.com.pl/mwichary/guidebook/index\">the GUI Guide book: i found this place this morning</a> and it looks pretty damn cool. loads of screen shots of OS\&#8217;s, including windows NT 3.1! I actually have a copy of this somewhere. it was the first real copy fo NT AFAIK, and was the only OS i know of that could install from ATAPI CDROM, but could not use it when it installed! no driver support! anyway, cool site.
