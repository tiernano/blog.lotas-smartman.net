On this day 2 years ago, it was my first day in college. it was also the day the world stood still. i can still remember it. unfortunitly, my post about what happened on that day is gone. theres a lot of stuff on [google][1] about it. i remember watching the TV for hours that day. i had just gotten NTL digital and had 7 different news channels. watching all i learned a lot and posted one very large post to my site at the time. it was a shock that it happened. just reading [this article][2], it says that 3016 lives where lost. it was at exacltly 13.46 GMT, or 8.46am New york time, when the first airline struck. to the familys of the people lost on that day, my thoughs are with you.
