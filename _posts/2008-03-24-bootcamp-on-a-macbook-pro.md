Well eirler on [Apple suprised everyone by releasing BootCamp][1], which allows you to install Windows XP on an Intel powered Mac. Well, there is some interesting info about that, but i will talk about that in a second. First, photos! Check out [this flickr set][2] showing XP booting on a Mac Book Pro using Boot Camp. Anyway, the interesting info: Check out this story on Digg saying that the Firmware of the new macs, [which was released eirler on too][3], [directly supports legacy BIOS emulation][4], and that BootCamp is really only a Driver pack for XP. In theory you could install XP, Vista and Linux on the box.
