<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20040401WinFormsMH/manifest.xml\">this MSDN TV video</a> shows you how to build non rectangular windows applications without writing a single line of code (well, you have to write code to get it to do someting!). pretty sweet looking tool. i have to play with this later&#8230;
