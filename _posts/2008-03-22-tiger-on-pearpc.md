I have talked about Pear PC before, so heres some good news and some really bad news. First, [Stefan &#8216;steveman&#8217; Weyergraf, one of the core developers, died on Friday][1]. I did not know the guy, but he will be remembered in his code and the way he help to create PearPC. The work will go on, which is good news, and [Tiger will run on it!][2]. Condolences to his family and friends, he will be missed, but not Fogotton. RIP.
