After yesterdays keynote speach, [Russell Beatie Tells devs at the WWDC to walk out.][1]. he is complaining about apples copying of[Konfabulator][2], who are talking the piss on their front page saying &#8220;Cupertino, start your photocopiers&#8221; just like apple had yesterday. Im looking at the screen shots of both Tiger and Konfabulator and they look identical! who is copying who now, Apple?
