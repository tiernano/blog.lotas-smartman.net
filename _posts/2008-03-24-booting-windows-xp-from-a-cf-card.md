I had an idea over the weekend whilst sitting in the back of the car, board, without a laptop. i dont like using my laptop in the car, and the main reason is i dont want to kill the hard drive. So, my idea was could you replace the hard drive with a CF card? Well, i found [this article][1] over at TV Harmony.com which tells you how to do it with a PC. it uses a CF to IDE adapter. now i wonder is it posible to get your hands on one of those but for laptops. I was looking at a few sites and they are selling older laptops (P3 600+ kind of range) fairly cheap. if i got my hands on one of those and took out the hdd, replaced it with a Compact Flash card (1gb or so) it would be pretty sweet. i know with 1gb (or even 2gb) it might be a bit of a problem with space, but it should work&#8230;
