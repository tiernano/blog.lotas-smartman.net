[engadget have photos of a HTC phone][1] which looks a lot like the Treo 650 (i think thats the treo 650 beside it in the photo actually) but insted of running Palm OS, it runs, wait for it, Windows mobile! Is Palm comming out with a windows mobile treo, is this a pre production sample that will never get built or what, but its a slight glimmer of hope. lets hope some service provider doesent cock this one up and say they dont want WIFI and break the bluetooth on it too, or make a total cock up of it and only release it for one provider&#8230;
