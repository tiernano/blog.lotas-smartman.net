[osnews is reporting][1] that [Mandrake linux][2] is offering advertising in the 9.2 download edition of their Distribution. The info is [here][3]. Thats actually not a bad idea to tell you the thruth. Mandrake is a great OS and as long as they aint adding in spyware, i think its a good idea. you gets ads on everything else these days, so why not your OS? and those who dont want them can either pay $5 a month for the mandrake club, or get a different distro. That being said, i think some people ove from windows to get rid of some of the spyware and stuff. they do say thats its screen savers, default web pages, bookmarks and installation pages. Cool, i think.
