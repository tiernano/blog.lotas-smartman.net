Wahoo! [NTL][1], my Broadband ISP, has just released a [1mb cable modem service][2]&nbsp;called ntl Broadband Max. Well, semi released. it will be here on Wendsday. So, for the next 2 days, im &#8220;suffering&#8221; with my 600k till i get my 1024k connection. <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> this will be nice and fast. its 1024k down and 256k up, compaired to my 600k down and 150k up that i have now. there will be no service disruptions to the site, now that im [hosted outside][3]. and its just a matter of me rebooting the modem. thats it! i love cable!
