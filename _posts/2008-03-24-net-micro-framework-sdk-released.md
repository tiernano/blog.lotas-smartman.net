Today Microsoft released and announced the [.NET Micro Framework][1]. the Framework allows you to build tiny .NET apps for tiny products, like [Coffee pots][2] (no joke!), and opens a whole new range of ideas. I have had some ideas too. I seen this [Wi-Fi module][3]&nbsp;called &#8220;Wi-ME&#8221; which could be encorparated into something interesting. 

My theory is a car tracking application. you would have one of these in the car, and a GPS reciever, which would log where you are to, lets say a CF Card. Then, if it finds an open access point with internet access, it would upload, securley, to a web service. It could be modified to include a GSM module so its on all the time, but its an idea, and posible.</p>
