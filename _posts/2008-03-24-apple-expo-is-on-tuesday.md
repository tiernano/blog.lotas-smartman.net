I mentioned over the weekend that the apple expo where the new G5 iMac is to be shown would be Monday. Well, i got dates mixed up. its tuesday. Check out the info [here][1]. No info on weather it will be broadcast over the web, but some speculation [here on Apple nova][2] says it wont because it will be 4am in the US when it goes live. but it will be 9 am here in Ireland and the UK, and 10am in Europe! anyway, we will see what happens tomorrow!
