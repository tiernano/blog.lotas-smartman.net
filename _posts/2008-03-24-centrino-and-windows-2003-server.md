Hmmm. Why is it so hard to get centrino wifi drivers for windows 2003 server? Well, in theory, your not to run windows server on a laptop, but being a developer, why the hell is it not posible? or at least semi posible. i still havent found it, but if anyone has a link to said driver, please post a comment. I have just installed windows 2003 server on my Inspiron 510m for development reasons (better to dev a site on a windows 2003 server when your going to end up deploying it on a windows 2003 sevrer). Hmmm. a bit of a pain&#8230;
