OK. Im in the middle of my first Semi major network upgrade of 2004. This envolves me getting my Athlon 1.3Gz system up and running with windows 2000 server or 2k3 server. I did get it running but with 128mb ram, it was quite slow and did not do a lot. So, this is the upgrade (and downgrade!). I took a 512mb DDR 2100 DIMM out of my workstation (the down grade) and put it into the server (the upgrade). Im buying a 256mb DDR 2100 DIMM tomorrow and that goes into my workstation. In a few weeks i get a second one, and the 512mb thats in the server goes into my workstation, where it should be! and the 2 256mb DIMMs are in the server. If i want a memory upgrade for my workstation i have to get ECC memory, which is about 2x as expenvice as normal stuff. Im thinking of getting 4 512mb DDR 2100 ECC DIMMs but its going to cost 500EUR+! Thats more then the board and 2 chips cost me in the first place. I also have a space PC133 128mb (NON DRR) DIMM sitting here which will go into the Linux server to bring that up to 384 Mb ram some time soon. It will be a while thoguh&#8230;
