So, i am in the process of buying a new gadget: a Fuji FinePix S7000 Digital camera. This thing is very cool. Takes both XD and CF cards, so my 256mb of XD memory is still usable! Nice camera and test photos are on their way. Also, i just got my exchange server up and running. It works well. it can cope with loads of email: i got all my mail, which was stored on my workstation using MailEnable over to the exchange server, and it coped well. all 11 thousand emails! Very cool stuff!
