[MSMobiles has some info][1] on a software suite called [Sync4J][2], which is an open source push email solution, which works with Pocket PC, blackberrry, palm and, strangly enough, iPod&#8230; Anyway, very interesting idea. i wonder if i can get this to talk to my exchange server and my pocket pc&#8230;
