Well, I have had the domain AngryViking.net for a while now and couldn&#8217;t really think of what to do with it. Other then having a cool email address (<tiernan@angryviking.net>) and being able to say I own [AngryViking.net][1] and [ImAnAngryViking.com][2], I couldn&#8217;t really do much with the domains, until now! I have just move them to a web host I have used for a while, [NearlyFreeSpeech.net][3], and I have a blog up there, which will host my rants and raves, in relation to anything I want to rant and rave about. First post, which is [just an intro is here][4]. **WARNING: The Angry Viking may/will contain stuff that I like to shout a lot about, make a lot of noise, and there could be bad language. It is no way representing the views of my employer and has nothing to do with them. Its just me being me. and Angry.**
