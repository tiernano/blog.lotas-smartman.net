Right. Today has been a day of free travel in dublin city. Well, dublin bus, the dart and actuall all CIE services have been free. This is because of the irish government wanting to turn CIE into a private company insted of a public company. That make sense? I dont know if it did. Well it was quite useless for me. I have a weekly ticket for the bus and train, so its pretty useless to me! CIE are at [CIE.IE][1].
