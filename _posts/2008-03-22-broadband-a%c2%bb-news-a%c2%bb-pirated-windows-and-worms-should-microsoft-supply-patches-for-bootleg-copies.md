[broadband Â» News Â» Pirated Windows and Worms &#8211; Should Microsoft supply patches for bootleg copies?][1] Interesting question. microsoft could also use this information to find out exactly how many leagal and illegal copies of windows are being used. security updates should be available to all, but extras, like Windows media player, etc, should complain.
