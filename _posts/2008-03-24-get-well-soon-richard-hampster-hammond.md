Richard Hammond, AKA &#8220;The Hampster&#8221; ([Top Gear][1] reference) had a crash at nearly 300MPH on Wedesnday. There is some info on&nbsp;[this BBC news page about it][2]. You can donate to the Yorkshire Air Ambulance Charity, the guys who brought him to Hospital, by [clicking here][3]. There are a lot of different links at the side of the BBC article. So, Good luck Hammond. We hope to get you back soon!
