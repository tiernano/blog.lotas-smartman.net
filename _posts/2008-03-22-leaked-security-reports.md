[Slashdot | Hacker Leaks Unreleased CERT Reports][1]. i remember when there was info about the security leak in IE (one of many!) that made it posible for someone to write a web page that formatted the systems C: drive. it was frowned apon becuase the code was included in the report and people could easly sent it to others and kill their systems.
