Im now running ISA Server 2004 BETA infront of my linux/apache server. This is pretty handy cause i can have multiple servers in the back on a single public facing IP Address. So, trying to get some other things working. Its quite mad though. there is my firewall/router with forards certin ports to my ISA box, which then does other stuff, like forwarding ports. Cool though. i can monitor traffic better this way too!
