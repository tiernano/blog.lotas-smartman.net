[Daypop &#8211; a current events/weblog/news search engine][1] and [Feedster :: RSS Search Engine][2] are two fine examples of RSS and RDF search engines. Feedster is fairly new, i think about a month old, and daypop was [reviewed by CNet, Dec 2001][3] so it must be a lot older. These make finding the latest news quite easy! check them out!
