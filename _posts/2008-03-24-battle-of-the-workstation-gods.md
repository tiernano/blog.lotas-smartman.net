[Game PC has a review][1] of the AMD Opteron 252 VS the Intel Xeon 3.6Gz with 2mb cache. very cool test. i likes what i sees comming from the AMD camp! i have already started thinking about my new workstation. the replacment to the dual athlon i currently have. i think the only other things to do to the current athlon is extra ram and maybe more hdd space. as for my new system, Dual opteron, Dual Xeon or dual core systems are on the list. i will be getting a windows/x86/x64 system, so the power mac is out the window, but we see whats in store&#8230;
