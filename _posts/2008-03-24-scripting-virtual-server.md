I have decided its time to setup a Virtual Server Data Center. I have moved my SQL server to my Dual Opteron box, its got 2Gb ram, and its got a lot of spare time on its hands. So, now, it also acts as a Virtual Server, um, Server. First thing to install is Team Foundation Server, which i am working on now, but one thing i wanted to get done first: Backup. Well check out this script on the Virtual PC Guy&#8217;s Blog showing you [how to do backup eaisly][1]. Very usefull.
