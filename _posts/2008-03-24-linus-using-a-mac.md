ZDNet are reporting that [Linus Torvalds has switched to a Mac][1]. he is running linux on it, mind you, but i like this quote from the article:  


> ZDNet Australia was intrigued by this remark, and sought to question Torvalds on why the man who has single-handedly revolutionised the use of Unix on the x86 platform would move away from it, and where he had moved to.</p>
