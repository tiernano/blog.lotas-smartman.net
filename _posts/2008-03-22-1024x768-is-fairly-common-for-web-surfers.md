54% of web surfers use a screen resolution of 1024X768, which 25% of them use a resolution of 800X600. on my workstation at home and work i use 1280X1024, the laptop is set as 1024X768, and most other machines in the house are at about 800X600. i better fix my site. just changed the res on the laptop to 800X600 and the ad on the top is being blocked by the side bar. anyway, the article explaing all this is [here][1] on osnews.
