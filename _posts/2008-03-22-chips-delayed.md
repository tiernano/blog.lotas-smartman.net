Right. the chips are delayed. i was ment to be getting them this morning, or tomorrow morning, depending on [DHL][1], but they havent left the [Kompeltt][2] place in Norway. they havent been processed yet!!! Im thinking theres probably a load of orders before me, so thats not bad. anyway, i got the conductive pen. a mate of mine had it. saved me about 26 euro!!! so, i hope the order gets processed today and shipped tonight. it may be here tomorrow, or friday. ill keep you posted.
