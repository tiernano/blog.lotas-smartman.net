I find a lot of interesting things on the web over the course of my day, and a lot i cant fully read till i get home. I find my self emailing a lot of links to my home email address, and then trying to find them though outlook when i get home. Well, i now found [ToRead][1]. You sign up, get a link for your toolbar that when you click, it gets the contents of the webpage, title, link, etc, and emails it to you for later reading. Very cool stuff!
