I have just started to use the new workstation pretty much full time. I have installed [Office 2003][1] (untill i can get a public BETA of 2007) and got it talking to my exchange server, and started using IE7 as my main browser, and well, im am definatly impressed! this rocks! pages load a LOT quicker then on XP. i dont know weather its the 2Gb ram, the 64bit processors, or Vista, but i like it! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
