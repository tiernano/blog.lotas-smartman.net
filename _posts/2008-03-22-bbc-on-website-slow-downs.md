[Slashdot | BBC on Website Slow Downs][1]. Hmmmm. i noticed this yesterday while watching the news on [BBC&#8217;s news][2] web site. I was watching a stream over a 600k link, the stream running @ 128k and it was running quite slow. It was duing office hours, so most people ware probably watching from work. just checking now, i cant seem to get into their broad band site, and now im only watching at 34k/s. and its not the live stream either!
