[Apple&#8217;s .Mac service][1] has just been upgraded. originally you got 100Mb of space on iDisk and 10mb of email. they upgraded it to 250mb combined. thats 125mb for iDisk and 125Mb for email. you can, how ever, set it the way you want, so you could have 200mb for iDisk and 50mb for email, or what ever you want. pretty cool if you ask me!
