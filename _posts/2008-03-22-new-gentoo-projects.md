[Gentoo][1] have 3 new projects, or updates to projects or something, and they all look cool. Firstly, Gentoo 2004. Gentoo will be released every 3 months (quarter yearly). more info on their [Roadmap for gentoo linux 2004][2] page. secondly, they have started work on portage-ng. more info on their [portage project page][3] and [here too][4]. finaly they have catalyst. this is cool. Catalyst allows you to build your own live cds, gentoo releases and game Cds! SWEET! i wanted one of these for making a gentoo DVD with live stuff (xwindows, gnome, open office, mozilla and other things, including java) and a load of packages too. this way i could use it in work (which is stuck with windows at the moment) and at home for installing systems. the catalyst page is [here][5]. the current copy allows you to build GRP sets but game cds and live cds will be available by the end of the year.
