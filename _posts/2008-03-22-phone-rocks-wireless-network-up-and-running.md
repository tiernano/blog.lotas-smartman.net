Cool! i got my phone, and it rocks a lot! and i got my wireless network too, and it rocks too. took me a while to figure out, but i think the network is running grand. havent gotten any text messages saying the nets dead, so its a good sign. the phone rocks a lot, so working on getting that fully working with the network. photos tomorrow. i promise! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
