<a href=\"http://www.macnn.com/news/23787\">MacNN are reporting</a> that M-Systems are offering 90GB, 2.5\&#8221; flast storage systems. This is some amount of memory for a flash system. they come with 5 year warrenty, run at 100Mb/s, and have support for fast security erase and sanitize which is something the DoD wanted! this is definatly cool. 90Gb fast storage. access time is less then 0.04 ms! nice for servers and heigh end graphcis systems that need that kind of speed. the 100Mb/s is burst, and it will run at 40Mb/s. i think my drive can go faster, but not sure&#8230;.
