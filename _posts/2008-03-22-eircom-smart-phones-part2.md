I posted about eircom smart phones eirler on, and after i posted that i realized something really funny. they dont charge you to use it! either that or my one was broke! i was playing around for about 5 min, which is says is 50c, and after about 5 min, there was still 50c credit. so, i ended the session, thinking it would the debit the money, but no. it game me my 50c back! so, i taped the internet button on the screen, hit google (multiple search engines available, and google is one, but suprisingly enough, [Eircom.net][1], eircoms portal site, was not listed!) and typed in slashdot, and it worked. no questions asked. just surfing normally. so, free internet access in a supermarket!
