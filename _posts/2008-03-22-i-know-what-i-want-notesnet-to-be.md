Right. i have a project on SF named [Lotas Notes.Net][1] and i have had a few ideas on what i wanted this to be. Now i know. I have a diary here that i use to write stuff in. I also have my blog, which has a lot of stuff that i want to find easer later on or tell friends about. The reason why i dont want to post everything i write on my notepage to the weblog is because there are passwords, etc on it. So, i want to make Lotas Notes.NET into a virtual notepad, which is searchable, sharable, remindable (email or text on reminder). Theres other stuff but i wont go into it yet. ill start work soon.
