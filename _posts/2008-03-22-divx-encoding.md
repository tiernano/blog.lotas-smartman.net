Right. i am trying to encode a [DivX][1] for testing pourposes and i have found out that [Gordian Knot][2] uses [Virtual Dub][3], which is multithreading. wahoo! my 2 processors are working together to encode a divx. now if it works, great, but if not, back to the drawing board. VDub is using between 80 and 95% of the processor so i know its using both!
