It wasn&#8217;t. its my fault. My image site now should be uploading the meta data telling Amazon that its an image for pushing down to the browser, but I am still working out how to get it working 100%. At the moment, its not. So, now to fix the issue&#8230; Hopefully I will have an update later.

[update] Well, its working. After some shouting, coding, hacking, a bit more shouting, and finally some tweaking, it works! If you have safari or firefox, [this link should work][2]. If not, something is broke. please leave a comment!</p>
