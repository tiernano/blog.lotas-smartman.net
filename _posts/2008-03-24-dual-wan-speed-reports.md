A few days ago I [mentioned that I was running on Dual WAN connections][1] at home. Well, here are some screen shots of the Speeds I am getting:

this is from [PRTG][2], which is showing my [RV042][3] with SNMP enabled.

This one is showing [FlashGet][5] downloading a DVD Image ([Ubuntu][6]) from a HTTP server.

At the moment, that is about the fastest I have seen both connections run. So far, so good!
