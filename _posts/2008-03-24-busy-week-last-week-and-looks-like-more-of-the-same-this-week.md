Sorry for the lack of posts this week, and i am pre-empting the same this week. So, here are a few quick links before the madness beings.

  * [Try Windows Home Server free for 120 days][1]
  * [ScottGu VS.net Performance tips for your machine][2]
  * [Caching in 10 minutes][3]
  * [new LUNQ provider for Flickr][4]

I am going to leave it at that. Hopefully will get a chance to post more later&#8230;</p>
