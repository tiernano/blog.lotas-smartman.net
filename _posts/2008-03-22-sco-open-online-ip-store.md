Haha! SCO has opened an online store for you to pay for your SCO IP code. $699 for a single CPU machine, 1149 for 2 way, 2499 for 4 way, 4999 for 8 way and 799 pre CPU there after. wonder who would actually pay! an other question though. A Dual Xeon with Hyperthreading: Is that 2 or 4 CPUs? still funny. [The shop is here][1], and [The Register report is here. ][2]
