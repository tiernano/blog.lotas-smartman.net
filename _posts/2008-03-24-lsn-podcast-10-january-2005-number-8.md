So, this is podcast number 8 and this time it was recorded on my Pocket PC. there are some blips in sound, which i reckon is to do with the direct encoding to MP3, so i might try this again tomorrow and see if i can get it working better. Anyway, the podcast is available [here][1]. As for show notes, the website address of the software i used to do the podcast is [www.vitotechnology.com][2] and the name of my new hoster is [www.rackforce.com][3]. The size of this file is 1.5mb. i might do one or two more of these casts, like a few minuites each, and post them every day, and then one larger cast a few times a week. what do you think? email me at <lsmartman@gmail.com> and tell me what you think! Ohhh, and [here is the photo of the screen][4].
