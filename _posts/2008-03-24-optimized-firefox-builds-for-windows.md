I use firefox, some of the time, for browsing the web (i&#8217;m currently testing IE7, and i like it). A while back i found [G4 and G5 optimized builds of FireFox for OSX][1]. well, today, care of the Download Squad, i have found [Optimized builds of FireFox for windows users][2] for processors such as AMD Athlons, Athlon 64s, Opterons, Intel P4s, Pentium Ms, Xeons, etc. Very cool stuff.
