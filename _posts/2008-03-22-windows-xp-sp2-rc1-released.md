<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/news/posts/1079999493.html\">Ars Technica are reporting that Windows XP Service Pack 2 RC1</a> is now available to download <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/sp2preview.mspx\">from the microsoft website</a>. its a 245Mb download, still concidered BETA, took 40 min to install on the reviewers P4 2Gz, and is not designed for production use. i had the pre RC version a while back and it was quite stable. i might try this. <a href=\"http://www.arstechnica.com/wankerdesk/04q1/sp2-beta-1.html\">There is a review of XP SP2 here</a> if you want to read any of the new featrues. Pretty sweet though.
