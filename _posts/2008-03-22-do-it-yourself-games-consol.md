check [this out][1]! a do it your self games consol. its called the XGameStation. the specs are [here][2]. 25Mhz 16Bit processor. Looks weird and sounds like a bigger version of the C64 casue it runs basic too! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> Ram expander there aswell! handy.
