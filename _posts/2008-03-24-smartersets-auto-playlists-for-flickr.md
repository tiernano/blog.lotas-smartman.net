If you use Windows Media player with an MP3 player or iTunes with an iPod, you probably use Smart Playlists or Auto Playlists: playlists automagically generated based on somthing (eg, songs rated with more then 3 stars, songs in a partiular directory that havent been played, etc). Well, now there is [SmartSetr][1]. it basically creates Flickr Albums based on some criteria you have set. For example, i have a [MobLog Photos album][2] which takes photos that are tagged with moblog (usually ones uploaded from my phone) and places them in&nbsp;one particular set. Very cool stuff!
