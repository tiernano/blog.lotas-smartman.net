Right. i still cant get this mac to boot from cdrom. i told the cdrom that it was master and the hard drive was slave but the system just comes up with the folder with the flashing system and question mark. so, i now dont know what to do. im trying to boot of the mac os9 cd from the imac. its version 9.0.4 and i cant install it from standard because when it trys to install the &#8220;new&#8221; hard drive drivers, the system just freezes. im thinking this is because you cant really upgrade to a lower version. so, im quite lost now. not sure what to do. might try and get it back into 9.2.2 and try installing the 9.2.2 upgrade again. might fix something. is there a way to find out what extention is crashing out? like a log or something? anyone know?
