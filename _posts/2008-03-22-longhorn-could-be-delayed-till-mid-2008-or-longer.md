[osnews is reporting][1] that long horn could be released between late 2006 and mid 2008, but could be released even later. this is a long time for an updated OS for the desktop. what, thats anywhere from 5 &#8211; 7 years and we will still have Windows XP? this could be the chance for other OS&#8217;s to take up the x86 market. My bets are on either Linux, or OSX if the [eMac 2][2] is released, or even if it isent and [apple drop the price of the iMac][3]
