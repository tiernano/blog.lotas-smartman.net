I had to post this. [the Slashdot crowd are complaining about Microsoft telling Premium customers][1] about vulnerabilities and patches. Now, this makes sense. its a simple information thing. and slashdot do it themselfs! they have their pay per view thing, which allows paying customers to get the latest news before evetyone else. So, how is what microsoft are doing different to slashdot? Its not like premium customers get software updates in advance of everyone else. its just &#8220;BTW, here is some security info about something. it will go public on monday&#8221; and this is Wedensday the week before. its more for IT managers to figure out what servers have to be rebooted, and checking other security updates, etc. Anyway, sorry for the rant. just had to get it out.
