[Low End mac has some benchmarks of 10.2.8 V 10.3][1] on an emac, 2 imacs, an i book and a power book. the results are interesting. and the imac results are even more interesting. i had some doubths that the imac would have problems running OSX, but this shows it will and fast. im thinking of putting a larger faster hard drive in since thats the only major problem with it since the stock hdd runs @ 4200RPM and the slowest hdd i have in the house is 5200RPM. the hdd im taking out of the workstation is 7200RPM so that could do.
