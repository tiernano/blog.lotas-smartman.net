[this canada.com article][1] tells us that men cant think rationally with beautiful women on their minds.  


> In a study conducted by psychologists at McMaster University in Hamilton, 209 students were shown pictures of men and women of varying attractiveness. The photos were from www.hotornot.com, a Web site that lets viewers rate the desirability of people who submit pictures of themselves on a scale of one to 10.  
> The students were then offered the chance to win money. If they rolled double digits on dice, they could accept a cheque for between $15 and $35 the following day, or wait a week to eight months for a larger sum &#8212; $50 to $75. After viewing pictures of &#8220;hot&#8221; women, male students were more likely to choose the immediate option instead of waiting for the larger reward.  
> Female students, on the other hand, were not swayed by images of &#8220;hot&#8221; men and chose the larger reward.</p>
