every time i login to my site to post something or find a link, i see google advertising on it and most of the ads where for blogging stuff. i though that there was a problem there cause not everyone who wants to read a blog, wants a blog. i wanted to see ads for the stuff i was talking about, like ads for a phone i talked about, or software i posted something about. now it seems to be working that way. hopefully this meens a happier wallet for me&#8230;. <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
