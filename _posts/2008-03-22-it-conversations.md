Found this site, <a href=\"http://www.itconversations.com/\">ITConversations</a>, and its a cool site. they interview different techie poeple, asking questions, etc, and then post the audio to the net. I was listening to the <a class=featurelink href=\"http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail92.html\">Robert Scoble </a> chat which was linked to by <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/03/09.html#a6924\">himself here</a>. There are a good few there to listen to. check it out.
