Man! IBM have some small drives, and that is quite small. 2-4Gb models. they will be for phones, palm tops, etc. this is pretty cool. also, info about [Hitachi&#8217;s 4Gb 1Inch hard drive][2]. ohhh. Hitachi are the guys who bought/took control/where give/work with ibm&#8217;s storage devision. not sure what way to put it, cause i dont think it was sold to them, but taken over by them as a kind of partnership. so thats where Hitachi got the technology. now theres a question. is it a [MicroDrive][3] in the ipod, or what? if it is, then its CF+ Type II format drives and theres a [6Gb CF drive][4] that you could put in and upgrade your ipod. sweet.
