Check out this Make Magazine article showing you [how to tag photos with GPS data][1]. some cool stuff. It would be cool if you could automate this. for example, lets say, taking a photo with a digital camera, and then telling the pocket pc that you took a photo. it could sync times and then with an app on the desktop, automaticly show you where and when your photos where taken. could be cool.
