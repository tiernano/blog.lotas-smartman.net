right. [My project][1] has just been updated. this is a complete rebuild of the software. i plan to make a CVS place for this, but [Sourceforge][2] is hard to get into with windows. there probably is an easy way, but i cant find it. anyway, Code and the browser its self is up there. the binary is [here][3] and the source code, written in VB 6 with SP5 is [here][4]. Code is still [GPL][5].
