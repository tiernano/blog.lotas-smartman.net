[Gamespot are talking about the New NGage QD][1]. Its a redesigned NGage, which aims to address the side talking issue, removing the battery when you need to put in a new game, and it looks a bit nicer too. Nokia has some info on their [site here too][2]. they say it will be $99 with contract or $199 without. Nice and cheap. Still only 3.4Mb memory on board, but support for 256mb mmc cards. plays original games too. Ã¬t might be time for a new phone&#8230;.
