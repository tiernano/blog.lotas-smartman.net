[Stopdesign | Throwing Tables Out the Window][1]. they take the Microsoft.com front page and redesign it with CSS. interesting. they reduice the size of the page by 62% and, say that in theory they could save **924GB** in bandwidth a day and **329 Terabytes** per year! thats going to be a massive saving! and the speed would be a lot faster too.
