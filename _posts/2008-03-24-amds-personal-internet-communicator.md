[AMDboard has some pics of the AMD Personal Internet Communicatior, or PIC][1]. it is one cool looking system. Powered by an AMD Geode 366Mhz Processor, has 128mb ram, 10Gb hdd, 4X USB, Audio, 56k modem, runs windows CE (not sure weather it is 4.2 or 5) and sells for $185 without a monitor and for $250 with one. Looks pretty cool. dont know if it will come out in Europe, and if it did, i can see one or 3 little things it should have. 1: network adapter, which it doesent mention. 2: option for WIFI, even if it is a USB wifi adapter. and finally 3: option to plug into a TV and not a monitor. I know in one way i am kind of missing the point of this, because it is meant to be cheap and easly affordable, but how cool would it be to have this as a second (or im my case 9th) pc somewhere in the house pluged into a TV? have it down stairs connected to the 28&#8243; TV and to the network, be it wirelessly or wired, and use it to watch videos stored on a server somewhere, show photos from your holidays to friends, browse the web or listen to music. i know you could build one your self, hell i have been giving it some major though over the last few days, but this is a dedicated machine, with windows CE and a really low end processor, which would do the job. I was looking at specs over the last few days and i think an athlon 2200+ system would be a little overkill for a system like this, and windows XP might be an over kill too. hmmmm. just thinking i have a spare P2 450Mhz lying around here with 128mb ram and a 6Gb hdd. i also have an other 3Gb hdd somewhere else and a P2 266 with about 192mb ram. between them i could have either one very nice system, or 2! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> wonder does windows CE 5 run on a standard Dell computer&#8230;
