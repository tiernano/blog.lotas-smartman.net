[LaCie &#8211; Bigger Disk Extreme][1]. 1.6TB, yes, terabytes, of drive space in a firewire enclosure. pretty damn cool. only thing is the price. its $1,199 for a 1Gb model and $2,199 for the 1.6Gb model. hmmmm. you could build your own with 4 400Gb hdds, an OS of your choice, and some sticky back plastic (well, maybe). might work out cheaper, but it wont be as cool looking. you could, of course, get it acting as a network stoage area though if you did. that gives me an idea&#8230;
