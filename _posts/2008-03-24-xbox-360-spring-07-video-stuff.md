So, thats cool! now, my only problem i have is machine support. My Media Center is my only Windows PC working. I have Windows servers (well, server, as my opteron died&#8230;), but its my only workstation running a non server OS. My Mac is currently running Vista x64, but due to driver issues, looks bad. I have just ordered an extra 4Gb of ram for it, so hopefully that will solve the problem (its not drivers as such, more resources, and i think the extra ram should, hopefully, solve the issue). the MCE is having problems with hardware. I dont know exactly what is wrong with it, but i will hopefully figure it out soon.

&nbsp;Anyway, Nullriver has just released a new, updated version of [Connect360][2]. It now supports streaming of the new formats. I have updated to the latest version, and found out most of my videos are encoded slightly wrong. I&#8217;m using [Handbrake][3] to rip DVDs and stream them over the network (makes my life easer so i don&#8217;t have to look for the discs) but it seems the default Apple TV option is too high&#8230;&nbsp; something i will defiantly have to look into&#8230;
