Hmmmmm. <a href="http://www.lotas-smartman.net/blog/ms_netbench.pdf" target="_blank">This benchmark</a> result looks dodgy. not 100% sure though. states windows is faster then linux. i know windows is faster at windows file sharing then linux, mainly because microsoft wont let anyone play with their technology, but Hmmmm. still weird. ever since i heard about them fixing the test of windows 98 V Linux in webserving (win98 Release 3, an internal build that would crash every so often, and redhat 2.1 (non advanced ed) that wasent patched for security fixes for years) i never trusted any of their results.
