<a href=\"http://www.windowsforms.net/default.aspx?tabIndex=6&tabId=42\">.NET Terrarium</a> is a game of sorts. you develop a creatre and let it loose in a world called Terrarium where it battels other creatures in the world. Its written in .NET and looks interesting. It uses P2P and XML WebServices, and Also Windows Forms and DirectX. Interesting stuff. I have to play with this when i get home!
