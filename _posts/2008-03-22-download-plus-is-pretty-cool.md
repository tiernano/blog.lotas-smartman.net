I just found [Download Plus][1].&nbsp;this is not to be mixed up with Download Accelerator Plus, this one works! (DAP kept crashing when i tried to download a few files at once. when i uninstalled it, i told them that. Also DAP kept showing me pop up ads. nothing worse then leaving a machine over night to download a large file and wake up the next morning and your screen full of popups, some of which trying to install spyware!) anyway, Download Plus is a free, open source downloader. works great! No Ads, and written in VB6. What more could you want?!
