about time! Finally, the graphics card was the problem. i dont know weather it was an AGP problem or something else, so we bought a PCI graphics card, and now the machine works grand. just installed XP and updates, and more to be done tomorrow. it works though, and she is happy because of that. never again! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
