<a href="http://lsnbackup.cust.nearlyfreespeech.net/1064338470filenamegenerator.zip" target="_blank">File Name Generator</a> is a little application i just wrote in VB for personal use, but can be used by anyone for blogging. basicly, its a tool to geterate a name for your files you want to upload to the web in the format

\[Unixtime\]\[name\][number].[extension].

which unix time being the number of seconds since the start of time, or 1/1/1970 @ 12midnight, name being the name of the file, number being a number of files, eg iof you want to upload 7 pictures all from the same time, you could put in 1 &#8211; 7 in there. and finally the extension, eg jpg, zip, etc. check it out. hope its handy to others as well as its handy to me. working on more updates to it soon!
