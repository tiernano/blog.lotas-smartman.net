<a href=\"http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/archives/2004/03/09/1547/unused-hard-drive-space-for-free/\">I posted a link to an article by The Inquirer</a> about how to get extra space from a hard drive. Well, one HardOCP reader tried it and got <a href=\"http://www.hardocp.com/image.html?image=MTA3ODkzMjMxNTJsOGhyOWE5UHFfMV8xX2wuanBn\">this as a result!</a> im going to try this on my 30Gb IBM drive to see if it works. since the drive does not do a lot, i can test it out.
