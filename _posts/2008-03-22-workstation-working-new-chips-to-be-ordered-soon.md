Ok. the workstation is now working, and working grand. im still compiling [KDE][1], not sure why. its taken about 2 days!!! i have my mouse fully working (including the wheel) and last ngiht i got my mail client (Evolution) working properly. im now getting back on track with email! sound still isent working, but [open office][2] is compiling too. hope its faster then the binary version! That was just too slow to use. so, im going to order my chips next friday. they should be here by about the monday after that. hopefully. getting the conductive stuff from [Peats][3] some time soon. ill post photos and stuff when i get them, and more benchmark results (Single and dual!). i think Sandra is available for linux. anyway, thats an other think i have to get working. Bluetooth! Hmmmmm. ill fix that soon.
