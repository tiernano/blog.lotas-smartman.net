Now this is a really handy tip from the Lazy Admin: [how to use WSUS without Active Directory][1]. You might be thinking to your self &#8220;why would i want to?&#8221; Well, i have the answer: Windows Media Center Edition 2005. it wont join a domain (without a hack) and it reduices the functionallity of the system when it is on a domain (no extender support, and you have to log in, which can be a pain with a remote control, and you cant remember where you left the keybaord). So, getting it to talk to your WSUS server without it joining the AD makes life a lot easer! i will be trying this eventually!
