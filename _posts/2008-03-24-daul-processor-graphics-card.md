[toms hardware has this news item about a new Dual Processor graphics card from GigaByte][1]. it has two Nvidia GeForce 6600 GT graphics processors and 256mb ram. its fast too. 14,293 points in 3DMark2003, what ever that means (just shows im not a gamer!). interesting stuff though. because its PCI Express, i wonder can you have 2 of them in a system using SLI? i know the card currently uses SLI for the 2 GPUs to talk to each other, but that would be something else. 4 processor graphics! heh.
