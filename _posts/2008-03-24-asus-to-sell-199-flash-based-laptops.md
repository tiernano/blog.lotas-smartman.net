Gizmodo have a story that seems too good to be true, untill you read a bit more into it. [Asus are going to start selling $199 flash based laptops][1]. thats the &#8220;Seems too good to be true part&#8221;. A bit more info in the post mentions they have a 7&#8243; display, and range from 1Gb to 40Gb of flash space. Now, in reality, 40Gb of flash based storage on a ultra portable laptop sounds very interesting, but some how i cant see this being a ultra fast machine (i dont think this will have a Dual core processor, some how&#8230;)
