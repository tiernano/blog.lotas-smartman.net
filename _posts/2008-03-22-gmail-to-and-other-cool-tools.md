[gmailto is a new app for windows][1] that allows you to click on mailto: links and open a gmail compose window. sweet. there are other cool links on that page too. [GML][2] allows you to load your mail that is stored in either a maildir or mbox into your gmail account. this is a cool feature and it works with windows and linux. i have to try that out now&#8230;
