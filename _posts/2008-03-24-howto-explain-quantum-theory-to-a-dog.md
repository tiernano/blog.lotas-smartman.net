Yes, dog. the one that barks. But, this guy, who managed to confuse me while i was reading his [explaining of quantum theory to his dog][1], seems to know what he&#8217;s talking about. Very strange&#8230; [update] even stranger, read the [Bunnies made of cheese][2] theory&#8230; Sorry, im off to bed. no more mad cap posts, for at least another few hours&#8230;
