Fear and Loathing has a very handy blog post on how to use the [ASP.NET Security Provider without using SQL Express][1]. Why would you want to? Well, simple really. I have a full on SQL2000 Server here at home, and eventually (probably this weekend) a Full on SQL 2005 Server. ideally if i can use the full on SQL server (either one) i can be using live data for development and testing. I know this is not ideal for a production environment, but its not a production environment! Anyway, very handy stuff!
