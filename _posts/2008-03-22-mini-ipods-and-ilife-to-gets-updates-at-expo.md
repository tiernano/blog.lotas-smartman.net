[Think Secret report][1] that apple will be releasing new ipods and updadates to the iLife suite of things, in january. the mini ipods will be 2gb and 4gb, will have stripes, and different colors. they will start at about $100US but its not known when they will be out. this sounds pretty cool. also there will be updates to the [iLife][2] apps. they also state that there is no new desktops or laptops, but an update to the [xServe][3] is expected. So, no news on the [emac 2][4] [tablet mac or the cheaper imac][5] yet&#8230;
