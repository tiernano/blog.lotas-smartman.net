I have been using Virtual Server and Virtual PC for a while now, and i have a tip mainly for Virtual Server, but it can be used on Virtual PC. Insted of using the standard Remote control software (Virtual servers web based one, or the smart client) use Microsoft&#8217;s Remote Desktop. It feels so much more responsive. i think it might be something to do with the display driver. if you use the remote control software, it emulates some VGA card. if you use remote desktop, it doesent and runs faster. Hopefully this is a handy tip to someone!
