&#8220;Now that Pixar and Walt Disney have gone their separate ways, does it make sense for Apple to buy Pixar? After all, both companies are run by Steve Jobs. And Apple, with its huge success in the online music arena, is beginning to look more and more like a content company, as opposed to a pure hardware firm. Plus, Apple is one of the best marketers around,&#8221; Paul R. La Monica writes for CNN/Money.

&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s an interesting idea,&#8217; said Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with&#8230; [[MacDailyNews][1]] well for one it will make apple some nice profits. i heard that Pixar is the only film company to actually make a profit on every film they have released. though is that will help from disney?
