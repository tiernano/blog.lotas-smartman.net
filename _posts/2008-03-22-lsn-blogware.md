Since im learning VB.net, im going to start a small project in it named LSN BlogWare. At the moment, i have just been playing with VB.net and havent gotten anything working yet, but plans are as follows:

  * The app makes HTML files with all data stored in some database somewhere, either MS SQL, MSDE or Access, depends on the user.
  * there (may be) support for Blosxom so all the templates could be done by it, not LSN BlogWare. 

Ill be working on some of it in the next while. Ill be uploading test stuff, and when it works, it will be online. not sure about license yet though&#8230;
