Because half my network runs Linux, and because the other half runs windows, i need a linux box and a windows box on the network for administration, and i need a windows box more because of programming under <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio\">Visual Studio.net</a>. So, to comprimise, im installing <a href=\"http://fedora.redhat.com/\">Fedora Core 2, Test 1</a>, under <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/virtualpc\">Virtual PC 2004</a>. I gave it 512mb ram, 16Gb hdd, and its only using one of the cpus. Im installing from ISO, and everything is going grand. i actually picked \&#8221;Install Everything\&#8221; when installing because it makes life a lot easer!

This Virtual PC 2004 rocks too! i have Longhorn on here, and it runs sweet. So more screen shots when i have this installed fully.
