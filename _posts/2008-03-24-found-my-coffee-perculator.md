I cannot beleve i lost the thing in the first place, but this afternoon, which looking for something random, i found my coffee perculator. now before you think its one of those machine dealys, its not. this used to sit on top on a little glass cup. you put ground coffee into the perculator part and pour water in and it perculates though the ground coffee and comes out as something drinkable. very cool. im slightly hyper at the moment though. i had 6 cups of coffee, 2 of which where espressos, before lunch, and an other 2 normal coffees after lunch. when i walked in the door at home, i had a capachino, and then this! so, thats my weekends worth of coffee before it officially started, plus the rest! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
