[Hitachi has announced that they plan to release 20Gb micro drives][1], like the ones in Compact flash hard drives and iPod minis, and also 1Tb desktop hard drives by 2007. This is cool. They also reckon they will be using the technology that helps this in laptop drives by the end of the year. This will make multi terabyte systems even easer to get your hands on!
