Ok, this is probably the dumbest thing i have ever heard. [Verizon want to charge Google, and other internet companies, to get access to their customers][1]. So, the idea would be that Verizon block access to Google from their network, unless Google pay a certin amount of money. they are saying that *&#8220;The network builders are spending a fortune constructing and maintaining the networks that Google intends to ride on with nothing but cheap servers&#8221;. *What about the pearing arangments with different companies? What about the fiber that goes into the Googleplex? in case someone thinks i&#8217;m defending Google, im not. I definding the internet as a whole. Who is to day that in 6 &#8211; 8 months down the road, Verizon decided to charge me for my site? what about [LibSyn][2] (they guys who host [my PodCast][3]), since they have a lot fo traffic from podcasters. [Microsoft][4], [Yahoo][5], [Flickr][6], etc, etc. If they can block and charge Google, what about the rest of us? I am already paying for my internet connection. Same with google, and the rest, so why be charged twice? Technically this service is being charged for 3 times: 1 from the consume, then by the Google or who ever, and then Verizon want an other cut? I wonder how many customers it will take to leave verizon for them to realize how stupid an idea this is&#8230;.
