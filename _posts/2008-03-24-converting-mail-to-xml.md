I have had an interesting idea. is it posbile to convert your mail archive (of which i have close to 300 thousand emails) into some sort of XML format, with just basic info about the mail (subject, who sent it, who it was sent to, who was CCed, body of text, date/time, etc) so that it can be imported into a SQL server (or come to think of it, just directly into the SQL server might be more interesting) and searched etc. data mining could be used, and it would be a sweet thing to play with. So, now to see if i can export all my mail from Exchange/Thunderbird to XML/SQL&#8230;.
