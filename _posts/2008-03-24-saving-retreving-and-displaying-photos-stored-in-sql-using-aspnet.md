Check out these 2 posts over on David Hayden&#8217;s Blog. [The first][1] shows you how to save a photo in SQL server, and then retrive it and display it, all using standard SQL server connectons, which is handy. [the second one][2] shows you how to save and retrive (but not display) the photos using the Data Access Aplication Block. i have had some ideas, which i want to start coding for my photography site (which now moved to its own domain at <http://www.tiernanotoolephotography.com>) but havent had a lot of&nbsp;time. i think its time to lock my self in my room, with a lot of coffee and try&nbsp;work this thing out&#8230;
