  * Your contact list will now integrate Windows Live Messenger, and show joinable session status
  * Messenger contacts can see what game you&#8217;re playing, and your gamertag
  * Marketplace will now have its own blade, which will be skinned independent of your theme
  * Users will now get inline achievement updates (i.e. see what achievement you just unlocked and how much it&#8217;s worth).
  * Low-power download mode and auto-shutdown
  * Progressive download: watch, fast-forward, and rewind partially downloaded movies
