FFS! [Russell Beattie was talking about Referrer spam and how it pissed him off because of stats][1]. well, i just got one worse! its killing my server! Some arsehole is hitting my server to spam my log files, and, well, they are hitting all the large pages with many requests to be done, and not only that, but the files are quite big. This is a complete pain in the arse! now, i have to find a fix for this. Sorry if the site is slow, but its not my fault! im sorry about this.
