[This tutorial][1] looks quite handy! basicly, it gets [blogger][2] to upload the posts you post to a server in XML format, then your server, with the help of PHP, parses the XML files and makes a HTML page, RSS and archive page for you (well kind of). and then you can make it look the way you want it to look. COOL!
