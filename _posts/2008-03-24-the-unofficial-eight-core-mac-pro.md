Well, CNet have done what i have wanted to do for a while, and thats put [2 of the new Quad core Xeons into a Mac Pro][1]. 8 Cores! \*drool\* [TUAW pointed this out][2]. mind you, being Apple guys, they still concider this to be a &#8220;Hack&#8221; and they talk about &#8220;void your warrenty&#8221; if you do this. Mac Guys: When will they learn! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Still no benchmarks (well, there are some on the CNet Review) but none from Toms Hardware or Anandtech (Anandtech usually do lots of DB tests)&#8230;
