<p mce_keep="true">Now, this is cool! Check out the [S3 Browser][1] for [Windows Live Writer][2]. Its a plugin that allows you to upload images, and anything really, to Amazon S3 and allows you to place a link directly in Live Writer. Makes uploading anything a lot easier. Only one thing i have noticed: Windows Live Writer needs to be installed on a machine not running Windows Server or XP x64 edition. I am thinking of installing Windows 2008 Server on my Mac Pro in the next few days, and this may be a problem&#8230; Anyway, have to play around with this.</p> <p mce_keep="true"><img border=0 alt src="http://images.lotas-smartman.net/image.ashx?id=59797447-bfe6-45ff-bafe-ec34aee6c0b5" width=650 height=487 mce_src="http://images.lotas-smartman.net/image.ashx?id=59797447-bfe6-45ff-bafe-ec34aee6c0b5"></p>
