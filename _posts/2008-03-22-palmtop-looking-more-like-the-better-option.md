Right. just looking at the dell and im thinking the Axim is the device for me. looks sweet, is about 350 euro for the 400Mhz model, 88 for a 256mb card and about 70 for a bluetooth CF Card. i might get WiFi, i might not. its not decided yet. pretty cool. hehe. with the bluetooth card, im always connected because of my phone. handy! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> wahoo. i can post to the palmtop too!
