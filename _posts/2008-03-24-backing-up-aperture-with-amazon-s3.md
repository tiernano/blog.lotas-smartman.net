Micah Walter has a blog post over at Oreilly&#8217;s Digital Media blog about using [Amazon S3 to backup your Aperture Vault][1]. Interesting theory, and would be very cool for working with photos on the move. Mind you, if your on the move, you&nbsp;may need one hell of an internet connection for uploading all your photos&#8230; considering I shoot in RAW (which weigh in at anywhere from&nbsp;4-8mb each) and then what ever changes I do to the photo (if any) plus the preview images, etc, you talking, for an average 6mb RAW image, to have about 10mb of files, total. so, you shoot 100 photos, that&#8217;s 1gb that needs uploading. you wont want to be doing that on a 56k dialup connection. Actually, that would take over 4 and a half hours to upload on a 512k internet connection! EEK!

[update] i would post this on the photography blog, but there are issues with it&#8230; Don&#8217;t ask&#8230;</p>
