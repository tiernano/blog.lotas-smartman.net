Right. i decided to see if i could get MovableType&#8221;> working with [PHP][1]. My front page is using PHP, so why not my entries? So i figured it out! wahoo! its now working. any original posts have been moved from .html to .php, but the .html ones are still there. there may be some entries linking back to the original .html ones, but sorry. ill try get them all gone soon!</p>
