[Forbs is reporting][1] that Computer Associates are offering Free antivirus to computer users for a year. this is pretty handy. Check out [microsoft&#8217;s protect website][2] for info. its in step 3 for this. 12months free antivirus is pretty cool. That being said, [Grisoft][3]&#8216;s AVG Antivirus is [Free for home use][4]. my sister is running this, i have norton antivirus, and my parents computer has the best virus protection ever: [Linux!][5]
