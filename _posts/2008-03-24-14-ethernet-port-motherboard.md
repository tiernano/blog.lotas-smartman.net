[Win Enterprises has a mother of a mother board.][1] this thing has  
Ten Gigabit (10/100/1000) & Four 10/100 LAN ports! 14 ethernet ports! its powered by an Intel Pentium M Processor, supports up to 8Gb of ram and also supports a Compact Flash card. there is only one thing i can think of using this for and that giant router! you could have 4 wan ports (the 4 10/100mb/s ports) and 10 lan ports, each with a dedicated 1Gb/s! hell, if you wanted, you could use some of the GbE connections for wan ports too! pretty mad! original write up on [The inquirer][2].
