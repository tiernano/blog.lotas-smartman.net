Oreilly.net [has this article on OpenMosix][1]. it talks a bit about [ClusterKnoppix][2] too. im actually just downloading ClusterKnoppix for testing. may as well. i have a machine here that can only boot from CD as it has no hard drive, so knoppix would rock, and clusterknoppix would rock even more! now to figure out what to do with it&#8230;
