Just testing new new version of [BlogJet][1][(][1]1.6) which now comes with built in [Flickr][2] support!

it also includes text replacing, which basically means if you type a word, like [Engadget][3], it will auto replace it with what you tell it to replace it with (i got [Engadget][3] to link to their site, same with [slashdot][4] and [Flickr][2]. Very cool stuff!&nbsp;<img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />&nbsp;Now testing the [Flickr][2] integration:
