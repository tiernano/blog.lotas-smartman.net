well, it&#8217;s been a while. Nearly three years. Been busy and lazy for the last while. Have started blogging at&nbsp;[Tiernanotoole.ie][2]&nbsp;using [Jekyll][3], and been trying to figure out what to do with this site. The&nbsp;[Geek photographer][4]&nbsp;blog is still there, and between this and that, most of the updates are to the WordPress install itself.&nbsp;

I have been thinking of moving this site to Jekyll. Would just then be html being served, no database, no security updates, but i would loose the ease of posting, like now though my iPhone.&nbsp;

So, let&#8217;s see what happens. Might get pissed off upgrading WordPress and managing the servers and move sooner rather than later. What could possibly go wrong?&nbsp;

[update] this is what happens when you don&#8217;t post a lot. My caching has gone nuts and that image, which was put up as an after though, won&#8217;t resize&#8230; Feck it anyway!
