[this engadget article][1] shows you some ways to podcast. interesting idea. unfortunitly i dont have an ipod, but that doesent stop me. i wonder will anyone release an app that will allow you to get the podcasted streams into Windows media player. especially 10. my phone and PDA will sync with WM10, and so will the new portable media centre, so insted of just audio in a pod cast, you chould have video too. now all i need is a bigger memory card and a portable media center&#8230;
