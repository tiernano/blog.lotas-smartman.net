[This is a link to a tutorial][1] on how to install suse 9 over FTP insted of buying the retail CDs. i did this before on suse 8.1 (i think) and suse is a nice distro. speaking of distros, i just installed [White Box Linux][2] on to the server. its based upon [RedHat Enterprise Linux][3] and is compatable with the RHEL SRPM Errata that is released. quite handy and up2date works on it too. so i just installed that and its working grand. but check the tutorial on suse out. very nice distro.
