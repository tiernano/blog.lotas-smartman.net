Due to [Fas][1] and the starting of the VB soon, due to hardware problems, naimly me not being able to get my PDA ([Sony Clie PEG-SL10][2]) or my Phone ([Nokia 7650][3]) talking to it, and also because of a problem with my hard drive not liking DMA mode under linux, which is a pity cause it works grand under win2k, i have moved back to win2k. This is weird. i have gone from XP &#8211; Linux &#8211; win2k in about 3 weeks, maybe more. Im ordering the chips tomorrow, and they should be here Wedensday or Thursday. should be cool. pics and stuff to be uploaded then.
