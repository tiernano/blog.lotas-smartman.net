[this slashdot article][1] talks about [this interview with Google CTO][2] Craig Silverstein, who says: *&#8220;When search grows up, it will look like Star Trek: you talk into the air (&#8220;Computer! What&#8217;s the situation down on the planet?&#8221;) and the computer processes your question, figures out its context, figures out what response you&#8217;re looking for, searches a giant database in who-knows-how-many languages, translates/analyses/summarises all the results, and presents them back to you in a pleasant voice.&#8221; Now that&#8217;s the search engine I want.&#8221;* Sweet! thats the search engine i want, but i dont think ill be asking questions about down on the planet! anyway, cool!
