Wahoo!&nbsp;New hardware this weekend! i am now the proud owner of a [Microsoft][1] [Optical Desktop Elete for Bluetooth with Finger Print Reader][2]&nbsp;(the link doesent have the finger print reader, but my one does&hellip;). The keyboard is nice to type on, and the mouse feals nice. the finger print reader is cool. i was playing with it for a while, but i have the problem in it doesent work with a Windows Domain. Ahh well, what can you do?
