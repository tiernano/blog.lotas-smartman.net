Ok. i just figured out why my site is running very slow. its a DB problem i think. i just checked the bottom of the page and it says that the last time i visited it took 37 seconds to load. so, because it takes so long to load the page, i now have to move it into my network again. i will see if i have time to do it tonight. sorry about the speed problems though&#8230;
