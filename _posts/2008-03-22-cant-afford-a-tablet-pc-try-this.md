[O&#8217;Reilly Network: Can&#8217;t Afford a Tablet PC? Try This! [Jan. 16, 2003]][1]. the post is a bit old, but handy none the less. great way to start testing and developing apps for the tablet pc. i found this tip in a MSDN magazine. wonder if windows xp sp2, which comes with tablet PC 2005, works with this. i have to try it out.
