Well, damn it anyway. the [FedEx][1] person arrived at my house at 11.58 and there was no one there to answer the door and sign for the package. well damn it anyway! the tracking site says it will be delevered by tomorrow at 12pm. hopefully there will be someone in by then. PS. for those of you just siging in for the first time, im waiting on a router and phone. more info about the whole thing is [here][2]. I already have the laptop, just waiting on everything else.
