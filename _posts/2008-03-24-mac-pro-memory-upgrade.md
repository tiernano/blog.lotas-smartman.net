I left a bit of a <a class href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/archive/2007/05/18/supporting-full-screen-mode-in-silverlight.aspx">criptic message</a> about a wait for playing with SilverLight hopefully being over tonight. Well, what i ment was i will finally be upgrading the <a class href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/archive/tags/Mac+Pro/default.aspx">Mac Pro</a> with some more memory. Vista 64bit was having some issues with just a gig of memory. Graphics card was not loading correctly. The memory arrived, and i will be sticking it in the machine soon, so hopefully that solves the issue! For thouse of you interested, it currently has a Gig, and im adding 4 more. That should be enough, right?! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

[update] Well, its done, and im posting this from the machine right now. some screen shots from Windows:
