Right. im playing with [StarDocks Object Dock][1] which is basicly a replacement to the windows start bar dealy at the bottom of the screen. this replaces it with a mac osx like object dock (hence the name). its pretty cool. had it working on my machine at home and it was sweet (Dual 2Gz Athlon, 1Gb ram, GeForce FX 5200 graphics with 128mb ram) but its a bit slow in work (P4 1.6Gz, 256mb ram, 16mb vid card). anyway, its working and looks cool. check out <a href="http://lsnbackup.cust.nearlyfreespeech.net/1066127184objectdoc.jpg" target="_blank">this pic</a> too see what i mean! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
