Things that are DOWNRIGHT IMPOSSIBLE to say when you&#8217;re drunk&#8230;

a) Thanks, but I don&#8217;t want to sleep with you.

b) Nope, no more booze for me.

c) Sorry, but you&#8217;re not really my type.

d) No kebab for me, thank you.

e) Good evening officer, isn&#8217;t it lovely out tonight?

f) I&#8217;m not interested in fighting you.

g) Oh, I just couldn&#8217;t &#8211; no one wants to hear me sing.

h) Thank you, but I won&#8217;t make any attempt to dance, I have zero  
co-ordination.

i) Where is the nearest toilet? I refuse to vomit in the street.

j) I must be going home now as I have work in the morning.

k) Look, it would be great to have a shag but I hardly know you and we  
will only feel really embarrassed and awkward in the morning.

l) That guy is looking at my girlfriend but I am sure its just  
because he knows her or something.

m) That chair looks wobbly and dangerous and I certainly wouldn&#8217;t try  
balancing on it with this short skirt on in case I fell off.

n) I must get to my bed as I could never have a really good sleep in  
that hedge.

o) I really believe in prohibition.

p) I honestly don&#8217;t think the rest of the city centre wants to see my  
bare ass.

q) No..you are not my bestest mate in the whole world. I&#8217;ve only known  
you for a few hours.

r) I&#8217;m sure those young women are extremely intelligent and have  
wonderful personalities.

s) Im sure my feet would be damaged for life if I take my shoes off  
and walk all the way home.

t) A creamy cocktail followed by 4 shots of tequila&#8230;?.surely that  
would be&nbsp; no good for my insides.

u) Me? go for a pee in the mens room because the ladies queue is too  
long? I&nbsp; don&#8217;t think so.

v) I\`ll just have a big glass of water before I go to bed so I don&#8217;t  
have hangover in the morning.
