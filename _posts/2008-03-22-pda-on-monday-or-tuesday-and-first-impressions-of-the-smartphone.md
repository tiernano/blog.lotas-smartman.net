Right. i was informed by Dell on Friday that the PDA (Axim x30) has been shipped. they say 3-4 days for delevery, but the laptop arrived in less then 2. so hopefully it will be here on Monday or Tuesday. Anyway, photos and info when i get it. but while im here, im still amazed by my new smartphone. thed one thing i did notice i battery life is not great. its got about 2 hrs when on GPRS, 3 hrs talktime, and 100hrs standby. i havent managed to last a day so far with out needing to charge it though! but the advantage is when its in its snyc cradle, it chages off the laptop/pc, so its not too bad. i copied a few MP3s onto its SD card and it works pretty well. one thing i would like to see though is a blogging tool for it. theres a few RSS readers for it. which are cool. but now to start coding a new Blog Poster&#8230;
