[This register article][1] talks about a new worm thats going around posing as a MS Update. its quite evil. got it about 15times in the last few days. neither MDaemon or Norton cought it yet, but i did! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> it looks like its from microsoft, and uses a MS like address (i got one for msdn.net and one from ms.com). so be carefull. tell your friends and family not to open these. Microsoft dont send their users, even the ones paying big money, updates via email. so, check [windows update][2] for the updates!
