The Universal is the new HTC phone that everyone (and me) wants. It looks sweet. Engadget has a [questions and answers section here][1] and [photos of the device here][2]. Looks nice, and i definatly want one! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
