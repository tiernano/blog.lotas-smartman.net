    This looks pretty cool. The idea of ASP.NET running on a Linux box, even though it&rsquo;s recompiled into Java Byte Code is pretty cool. Since I&rsquo;m a VB Developer&nbsp;and I&rsquo;m learning VB.NET and ASP.NET, this would be a cool thing to play with. Going to download a trial and see if I can get my copy of Apache to talk to Java. This may take a while.

        <a href="http://www.mainsoft.com/" title="http://www.mainsoft.com/">Mainsoft</a> has a product called Visual MainWin. It appears to offer an extremely well integrated solution for taking your .NET enterprise apps (ASP.NET and ADO.NET) and integrating them into your J2EE environment seamlessly.
