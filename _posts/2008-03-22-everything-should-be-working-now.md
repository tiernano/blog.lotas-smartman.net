Ok. everything should now be running properly. i hope. the linux box is now kind of redundant, only acting as a DNS server for the network. the plan is to kill that, add more ram (i have a spare 128mb dimm here, which should bring it to 384mb ram) and install windows, either 2000 or 2003 server. once they are installed, im not sure what to do then. ill have to figure it out. probably will be done by the weekend. the SQL server is now on a faster machine as is the web server. i said that last night. info is [here][1]. i hope to have some proper posts today.
