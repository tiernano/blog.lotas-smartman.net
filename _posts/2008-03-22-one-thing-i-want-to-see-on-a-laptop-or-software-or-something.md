not sure where this should be enabled, but one thing i would like to see, probably actually in windows, is the ability to choose what to do when you close the lid depending on the state of the system. if its on AC power, do nothing, but if on battery, hibernate. or something simular. would make downloading large files a lot easer. you could set it to download a 200mb video, like the one im downloading from [ the msdn now about longhorn][1] and be able to close the lid and do other stuff. this should be in power options in the control pannel. wonder will i get this feature? anyone listening? <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
