Intels new chipset, Napa, [will support RAID][1]. this would be sweet! In the post they ask who wants a 2.5Gz Pentium M with 200Gb of RAID array and a nice grapics card. Well, i think i will be waiting for early next year when the dual core, 64bit laptops start comming out, with 2 7200RPM hdds (which should be at about 160Gb by then) with a 17&#8243; widescreen, HD display, and some sweet battery life. now your talking!
