[the british pathe site][1] has a total of 12 million pictures online. thats a lot of photos and storage. it was done my scanning every inch of the British Pathe archive of 3500 hours of 35mm film and put online. there is one photo for every minute of film. wonder if they will ever put the film online? theres a reuters article [here][2]. and if your into that sort of thing, you should check out [archive.org][3]. loads of stuff there.
