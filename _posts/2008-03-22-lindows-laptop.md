At $799 for the system less CDRW drive, its not bloddy bad! i wanted a Dell, not sure number here, its a Celeron 2Gz, 256mb ram, 20gb hdd and a few other things, but its about .1400. with the Lindows machine, i get a 933, 256mb ram and 20gb hdd. its smaller, weighs 2.9lb and just looks kool!!! theres a video [here][2] by [Chris Pirillo][3] and he really likes this laptop (bit nuts he be) but if hes not being paid to say all that cool stuff (watch the vid!) he must really like it!
