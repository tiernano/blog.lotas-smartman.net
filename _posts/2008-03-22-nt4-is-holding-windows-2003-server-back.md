[this ZDNet report][1] states that Microsoft&#8217;s NT4 is holding windows 2003 server back.  


> Gartner estimates that by the end of 2004, as much as one-third of NT 4 users will move to Windows Server 2003. &#8220;Two-thirds to 75 percent&#8221; will still be NT 4 customers by the end of next year, said Gartner analyst Tom Bittman. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of NT 4 dark matter out there.</p>
i wonder how many will move from windows alltogether? OSX looks really nice, and is cheaper for lots of users ($999 for unlimited licenses, compaired to Microsoft&#8217;s per user license) and Linux is free, so of the 2 thirds that are not moving to 2003, what % stay MS Customers?
