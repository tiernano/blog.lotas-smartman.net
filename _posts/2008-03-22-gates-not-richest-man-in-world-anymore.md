<a>the register are reporting that Gates is not the ritchest man in the world anymore</a>. he is now second to *\&#8221;The Swedish founder of the IKEA furniture chain\&#8221;*, Ingvar Kamprad. the <a>forbs survay of the top ritchest people</a> put gates at number 1 and Kamprad at number 13, but the Sweeds reckon that a weak dollar has caused the calculations to be wrong. Kamprad is estimated to be worth $53Billion and gates is worth $47Billion. and im no where to be found on the list. <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> bk_keywords:microsoft, bill gates
