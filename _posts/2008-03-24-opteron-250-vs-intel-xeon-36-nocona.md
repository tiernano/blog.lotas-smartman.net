[this review over at Anandtec][1] just shows that the Opteron is what you want to go for if your running a large database server. Interesting review. one question though. They test using windows 2003 Enterprise server 32 bit edition. i know why (no x64 version of SQL Server, AFAIK) but i wonder what which would be faster on the x64 versions of both 2003 server and SQL Server.
