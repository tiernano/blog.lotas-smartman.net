Check out [this article over at Tourney Logic][1] about how to get dotTEXT to support podcasts. only thing i dont like about it is that the server that dotTEXT runs would have to host the file. since my server is in house and has limited bandwidth, i would prefer the option that WordPress gave me which was to add a URL, type and size to a given post. though one feature of the dotTEXT implemention is nice. each post that has an attachment will show that in the post its self. time for some hacking i think! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
