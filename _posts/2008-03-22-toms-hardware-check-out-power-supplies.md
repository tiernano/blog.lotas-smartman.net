[tom has this article][1] with info about hard drives. he starts with &#8220;*<font color="#FF00FF">The new top processors from AMD and Intel continue to raise the bar for power needs of PCs: a CPU alone sucks nearly 90 Watts. The new graphics cards also place high demands on power. Requiring up to 70 Watts in 3D mode, the GeForce FX 5800 Ultra Accelerator is not far behind the processor in power consumption requirements.</font> * interesting read. im in the market for a new power supply. the one i have now is a 300 watt, and when i get my chips and the 2 hard drives, and the rest, ill need more power. maybe 550W is enough?!
