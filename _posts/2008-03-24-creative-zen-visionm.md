Check out the new [Creative Zen Vision:M over at Engadget][1]. Looks extreamly cool! I want one of those! Why this over the G5 iPod? WMA/WMV support! since i am a [Napster][2] Subscriber, i get a lot of music as WMA. Also, since i have my media center, all my ripped music goes to WMA. and video is stored in a WMV type way too. And it looks cool too!
