[engagdet are reporting some info about a new iPod][1] which they say could be out soon. Color disply and home on iPod, which sounds really sweet. What is it? keep your home directory with all your settings, docs, etc, on your iPod! now how cool is that? I actually [posted back in march][2] about this.
