[#develop Fidalgo RC1][1]. Cool. i like the feature to move entire projects from VB.NET to C# or the other way around. handy since i want to learn C# and trying to figure out how to do something in C# that i know how to do in VB.NET. also handy for the other way round: finding code in C# and wanting to add it to VB or something. have to try this when i get home!
