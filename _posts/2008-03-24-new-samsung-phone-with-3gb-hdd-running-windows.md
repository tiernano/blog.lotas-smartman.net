the Overclockers club are reporting that a new [Samsung phone with a 3Gb 1Inch HDD will run windows][1]. Not sure weather it will be Smartphone Edition or Pocket PC Phone edition, but it will be cool. 3Gb is a lot of storage for a phone like this, and thats a lot of movies/pictures(it has a 1.3MegaPixel camera)/muisc, etc. no news on when it will be released either&#8230;.
