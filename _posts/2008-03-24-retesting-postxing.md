So, just checking to see if [PostXing][1] works with my upgraded build of [Community Server 2.0][2]. I love this  
interface. and there are so many things that could be done with this since you  
have access to the source. once this i would LOVE to have, and have been working  
on (not directly for PostXing, but could be used in it) is a Flickr add on, so  
you could pick a photo from [Flickr][3], and add  
it directly to your blog post. it would make life a lot easer. insted, i have to  
hack some stuff to do it&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
