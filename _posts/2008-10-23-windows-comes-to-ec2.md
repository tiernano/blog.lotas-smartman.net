So, a couple of weeks back, Amazon Announced they would be bringing [Windows to EC2][1]. Well, this morning, it happend. And, the BETA for Non Windows [EC2][2], went away.&#160; It was [announced on the AWS blog][3] along with some extra bits, but the big thing i am interested is running Windows. 

So, the pricing for Windows is as follows: Small instance: $0.125, Large is $0.50 and an Extra Large is $1 per hour. High CPU is set as $0.30 for Medium and $1.20 for Extra Large. I am just looking more into it now, so i will probably update you later, but so far so good!!!
