Right, i made that number up, but this is an other post about heat! its getting just annoying now. my fans are useless. well maybe there useless, or it could just be the environment. so im now looking at [2 of these][1]. I want to find out will peats take back the other ones. i know they have been used, but i did spend EUR40 on them and they dont do the job. i hope them bad boys above do the job!!! I am looking at water cooling still, but i think ill put that off for a while.
