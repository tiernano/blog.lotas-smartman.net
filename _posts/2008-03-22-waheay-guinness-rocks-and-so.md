Waheay! [Guinness Rocks][1]! and so does coffee. i have always been told that if you like coffee, youll like guinness. must be right!

> On the table sits heaps of geek- a Thinkpad, an iBook, an old crusty iPaq, a bluetooth dongle, a watch, a fancy IR keyboard, a stand&#8230;. and the drink of champeens &#8211; Good Ole&#8217; Guinness (my drink of choice outside of coffee).
