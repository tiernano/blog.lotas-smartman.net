Just a quick note. My exchange server is off line for the next day or so. I got in this afternoon after work and the fan started making weird noises. when i took the machine down, i also realized that the machine doesent have any extra fans in it! So now i have to get a new CPU fan, maybe 2 (one for the other server) and also get some case fans for both machines. There may be some down time if i get a second fan for the other server (just in case).
