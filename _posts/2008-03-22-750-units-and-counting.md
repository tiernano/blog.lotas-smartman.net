[500 units done][1]. who would have though that 36 days later i would have done an extra 267 units?!!! Thats an average of 7.4 units a day!!! by that rate i should hit the 1000 mark about 1/August/2003. but because of the new machine, im actually doing about 11 a day. lets see. that works out at between 21/7 and 22/7. lets hope it works out like that! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
