I&nbsp;mentioned last night that I had a [Link blog][1]&nbsp;when I was talking about [using Google Reader][2]. &nbsp;It occurred to me: Do you want to see, lets say, the last 10 items I have shared (if any) posted to a new post on this blog? I could write a service that downloads the feed, gets the last 10 items, and after doing some checking (have these been posted before, are they in the last day, etc) post them to the blog here. Its a fairly simple thing to do with RSS, but the question is should I? Leave a comment, either way, and if I get no responses, I will work on it over the weekend! You have been warned!</p>
