If you needed any more proof, check out these pictures of this burnt and charred 12-inch Powerbook, caught in an apartment fire, which despite the damage and encrustations is reported to still work. What can we learn from this? **In a kickboxing match between Jesus and Jobs, Steve *would win***. I know it&#8217;s shocking, but if there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned from Internet, it&#8217;s that digital pictures cannot lie. They don&#8217;t even have tongues! (*Thanks, Marcus!*)
