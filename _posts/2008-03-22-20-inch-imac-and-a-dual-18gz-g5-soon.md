[think secret reports][1] that apple may be releasing a dual 1.8Gz G5 [Power Mac][2] and a 20 inch flat pannel [iMac][3] as soon as tuesday 18th november, which is tomorrow. no hard evidance of this, but sounds good. since the only dual G5 system is the dual G5 @ 2Gz, a dual g5 @ 1.8 would be nice too. as for the [iMac][3], im not sure. i dont really like the new imacs. not sure why. they look weird. now the [eMac][4] is nice. its just like a big imac!
