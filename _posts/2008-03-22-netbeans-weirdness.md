i have started to use [Netbeans][1] as my IDE for java compliation, and its good but has a few little niggles. one: its slow! for some reason my work machine, a 1.6Gz P4 with 256mb ram running windows 2000, has problems leaving it open all the time. when i surf the web and then go back to net beans, its asleep and takes ages to awake! havent tried it at home, but im thinking its a memory thing. also, when working on a project with a few classes, it doesent like having a few &#8220;Filing systems&#8221; open or mounted at the same time. found that out the hard way! other then that its pretty cool. nice change from notepad.
