[jobs said on wendsday][1] that  


> &#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly technically feasible to port Panther to any processor,&#8221; Jobs said at a meeting with financial analysts. But Jobs said the company is happy with IBM&#8217;s PowerPC family of chips and feels the performance is &#8220;quite competitive.&#8221;</p>
. well now i have a mac, its not as important for them to move to Intel chips, or AMD for that matter. also, from what i have seen with iTunes, you need a faster machine to run iTunes on windows (PIII 500) then on a mac (G3 400 recomended, but a G3 333 will (hopefully) run it).
