<a href=\"http://www.masternewmedia.org/2004/03/06/from\_288\_to\_broadband\_web.htm\">this software is well handy</a>. It gives you an idea of how your page feels when loading at different speeds. Like i used it to see how long the blog takes to load on 28.8k modem, and its actually not that bad. it takes a bit of time for it to fully load, but theres stuff there you can read. Strangly enough, the-hairy-one.com loads fairly quick too. Its actually cool to see how good it works. Check it out.
