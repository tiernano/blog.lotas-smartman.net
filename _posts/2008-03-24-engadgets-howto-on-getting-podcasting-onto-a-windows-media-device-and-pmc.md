[This howto over at Engadget][1] shows you how to get your podcast feeds into a PMC or other windows media device. very interesting read. i have tried this on my PPC and smartphone, and it works cool! i have to get a bigger media player, or a PMC, cause that would rock. and if anyone manages to get video over the RSS feeds too, it would make life so much cooler! anyway, check it out!
