Vista SP1 has been released. Vista team have [info here][1]. [[Via Alexia][2]] I have been running this for the last couple of months, even the RC and BETA builds, and i am very happy with it. Also, if you are not reading this though an RSS reader (my feed, by the way, is at <http://feeds.lotas-smartman.net/lotas>, hint, hint&#8230;), you will have noticed my new look for the site. Tell me what you think (email me at tierno [at] lotas-smartman [dot] net).
