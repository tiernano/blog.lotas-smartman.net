[Eircom are offering FREE WIFI internet access in certin parts of dublin, and other palaces too][1]. if the session id expires, which it probably will, on the [eircom.ie][2] front page, at the bottom, if it is not in the latest news items, click older news and find the one entitled &#8220;eircom provides free wireless broadband hot spots across central Dublin&#8221;. and McDonnalds gets an upgrade too! wonder will they upgrade ALL phone boxen or just some?
