[MSFN &#8211; Universal Windows Slipstreaming and Bootable CD Guide][1]. very handy. wonder can you install hot fixes directly into the CD, or even other apps. it would be cool if you could make a DVDR with windows xp, SP2, drivers for your machine, nero, visual studio, office, etc. though it might be 2 or 3 DVDs with a lot of extras. i know you could ghost it, but what if you change hardware? at least this way, it would still work, but the drivers would be off slightly&#8230;
