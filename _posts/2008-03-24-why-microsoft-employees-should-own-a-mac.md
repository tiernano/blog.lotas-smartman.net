I found this post over on the MSDN blogs entitled [Why Microsoft Employees should own Macs][1], and i agree fully with the post. I own 2 Macs at the moment (a very aging 333Mhz iMac G3 with 284mb ram running OSX 10.3, acting as a file server, just because i cant think of anything else to do with it, and a 1.33Gz PowerBook G4 with 1Gb ram acting as my main photographic machine), and not only that, i am looking at the MacBook Pro! now with the news of <a HREF="/archive/2006/04/05/12385.aspx">BootCamp</a>, if i get the [MacBook pro][2], i would be dual booting Windows and OSX, Buy why OSX? Simple: Photography.

I have a <a HREF="/search.aspx?q=350D&p=1">Canon EOS 350D</a>, and i take quite a few photos with it. I shoot maily in RAW, because i can, and because it gives me more control over my photos. Unfortunitly, Windows XP, and the Feb CTP of Vista (havent tired newer builds, yet) dont have CR2 support, which is canon&#8217;s RAW format. Which leaves me with a kind of predicument: Do i shoot in JPEG and loose some of the RAW features, or do i use the Mac. Well, you can guess the answer (hint: Mac). 

I would like to move my photography stuff to a Windows box, but with apps like [Aperture][3] and [iPhoto][4], and no equivilent, yet, on a Windows Box, i will be sticking with OSX for a while yet&#8230;
