I just checked my email and i have a folder set up and a rule set that all mail from my blog, which a specfic word in the subject, is taken and put in this folder. now, every comment that is posted gets emailed to me. some comments, if they have a URL in them have to be checked by me before they go on the site. well i just checked it and it said there where 686 email in it! after reading one or two, i found out that someone had decided to spam my site. quick comming in MySQL and bam! they are all gone! but still, a pain in the ass. I just wish wordpress had a better spam control system.
