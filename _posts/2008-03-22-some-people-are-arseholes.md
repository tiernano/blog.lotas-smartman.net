I got an email this moring from some bloke calling me a jackass. Basicly, my mail server sends an email when someone sends me a virus. now, on most occassions, i have this turned off, but over the last few weeks i turned it back on after a friend sent me a legit email with a virus attached that he did not know about. anyway, this arsehole, Craig Fortner, wasent too happy with my mail server sending him emails telling him he had a virus, and then went and told me to read up about them! He also told me, in a later email, to complain to my isp about this. Well, i told him i was my ISP. most of the time i just dont even listen to some of these people. on occasion i will reply and try and explain that its the viruses fault, not mine. Some people though&#8230;
