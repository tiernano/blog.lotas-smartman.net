I currently have a WRT54G wireless router running the network in my house  
(both wired and wireless) and its one of these very hackable routers. So,  
surfing the web, for something completly different, i found these how tos for  
it:

[WRT54G Bandwidth usage log][1] 

[Remote SSH access and SSH tunneling  
with the WRT54G][2]

Very cool and handy things to play with.
