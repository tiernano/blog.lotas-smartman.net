Check out [laks][1]. They have a Watch with built in USB memory. starting at 42Euro for 32mb and working up to 93Euro for 128MB, its not a bad price. it looks pretty class, but i usually get steel watches, just because they seem to last longer. the watch im wareing now is about 4 years old and the only problem i have had with it was battery. this still looks good and i would think about it. Very cool!
