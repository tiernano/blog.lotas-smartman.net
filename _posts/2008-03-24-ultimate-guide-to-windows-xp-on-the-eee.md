<p mce_keep="true">A few weeks back i bought an [EEE][1], and i have been running [Ubuntu][2] on it since. Problem is i cant get it to talk to my wireless network in Work. So, i decided to build an nLite copy of XP and its currently up and running (minus one or 2 drivers). anyway, check out this tutorial over at i64x showing you how [they setup the ultimate XP install for the EEE][3]. it uses less the 600mb of the 4gb storage of the device, and can boot in about 20 sec. This is cool. once i install my drivers, i will be back online and following the rest of these instructions!</p>
