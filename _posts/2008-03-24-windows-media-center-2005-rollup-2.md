There is a new update to [Windows Media Center 2005][1], [RollUp 2][2], which adds support for XBox 360 as a media center extender, some other features, and most important (for me anyway) support for Ireland in the TV Listings! Something else which is interesting is DVD changer support. You can get a changer which will hold about 200 or so DVDs, and leave it there. plug it into your media center and you can easly pick any DVD out of your collection and play instantly! no looking for DVDs any more! only one problem on my end: i dont have 200 DVDs to pick from&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
