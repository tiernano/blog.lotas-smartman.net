The photography site i build uses quite a lot of GUIDs for photo IDs. Mads, over at .NET Slave, has a post showing you <a class href="http://www.madskristensen.dk/blog/PermaLink,guid,6159d77c-0ac4-4a95-8efa-ae55fb7a80f8.aspx">how to make your GUIDs smaller</a>&nbsp;and still get them back to the original GUID. Handy stuff. i might borrow that from him!&nbsp;
