Right, i have an idea for a website, which i wont be announcing for a few days (need to get it deved up first) but while in the planning phase, i found some interesting links some of you might find handy.

[Web clustering with Amazon EC2][1]

[MySQL replication on EC2][2]

[Amazon EC2 ephemerical storage (/mnt) and MySQL][3]

[EC2 best practices][4]

[Amazon EC2 + S3 doesn&#8217;t cut it for real applications][5]

&nbsp;

Now, there are a lot more bits up there about this, but since i am still finding them, and trying to work out my best plan of action, i will leave it at that&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
