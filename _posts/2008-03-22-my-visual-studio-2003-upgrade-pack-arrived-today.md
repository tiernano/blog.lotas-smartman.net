Microsoft had an upgrade option for users of visual studio 2002. They could get 2003 for 29 us$. It worked out at about EUR31 which is cool cause the normal upgrade price is about EUR1095! So i ordered my pack on monday, expecting a cd or two in the post and it arrived today, by UPS of not just a few cds either. It was a proper pack: total of 7 cds, six posters, a few other things and a 200+ page manual! Cool or what! Going to install vs2002 and 2003 tomorrow and vs6 after the format last week. Cool for 31 euro!
