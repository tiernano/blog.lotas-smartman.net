So, its been one of those months. busy, busy! I havent had a chance to do a lot of blogging, but, hopefully i will over the weekend. but just some quick updates on whats going on.

First, the blog, which is currently [hosted in France][1], will be moving back home over the weekend. Its not that i am not happy with OVH, the guys running the server, but its because i now have extra bandwidth to play with. i hope to start the move over the weekend, and you should not notice any down time (Famous last words&#8230;).

Next, a mobile version of the site is now live. Thanks to the guys at MoFuse, I have 2 versions. 1 for mobiles and one for iPhones. the links are as follows:

  * Mobile version: <http://tiernano.mofuse.mobi/>
  * iPhone Version <http://tiernano.mofuse.mobi/iPhone/>

I have been playing with it on the iPhone and it works quite well. So, hopefully, a more normal post schedule will return soon&#8230;
