[this slashdot article][1] talks about [ SURBL, or &#8220;Spam URI Realtime Blocklist&#8221;][2], which insted of checking IP addresses or mailservers from where the mail came from, it checks the URLs in the Email to see if they are black listed. Very smart!! This is ingenious! Now to get sendmail to use it on my machine&#8230;
