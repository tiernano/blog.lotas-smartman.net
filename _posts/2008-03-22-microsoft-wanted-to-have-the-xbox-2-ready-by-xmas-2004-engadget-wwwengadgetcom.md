[Microsoft wanted to have the Xbox 2 ready by Xmas 2004 &#8211; Engadget &#8211; www.engadget.com][1]. theres a mock-up of the XBox 2 in there too. looks good. wonder will it even be the same form factor. i remember seeing photos of the original XBox, which was just a big X Box, literally! ill see if i can dig out a photo of the original and post it here.
