I got me a [LibSyn][1] Account, so my podcast is currently hosted [here][2]. I will hopefully get dotTEXT talking to it soon, so you can just subscribe to one feed and get everything. Speaking of which, if you are using the current FeedBurner&#8217;ed RSS feed, please re-subscribe to <http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/rss.aspx>. more stuff will be arriving there all the time. plus, its a full feed too, with HTML, etc. and hopefully soon, enclosures! The RSS feed link for my LibSyn account is <http://lotas.libsyn.com/rss>.
