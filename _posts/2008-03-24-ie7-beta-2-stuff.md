So, sorry for the lack of posts, a few friends of mine got Married (Congrads  
to Elaine and Charlie!) and I have been busy with that and stuff. While i was  
away, [IE7 BETA 2 has  
landed][1]. Now it is available for Both X64 versions of windows and windows  
2003 server, as well as XP. Very cool. I installed it a while back, and i love  
it. Lots faster then IE6. So, to play with some of the features, i added IE7  
search support to the blog. If you have IE7 installed, you should now see the  
drop down button at the search bar light up, and when you click, you should see  
Tiernans Comms Closet Search with a little asterisk beside it. you can add it as  
a provider so you can search with it quickly. VERY Cool! How do you do this? [Check this  
post by Erik Porter][2]. Very easy to impliment! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Good luck!
