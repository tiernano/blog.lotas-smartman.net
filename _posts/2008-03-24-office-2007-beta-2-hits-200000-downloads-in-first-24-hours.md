Wow! Office 2007 BETA 2 was only released about 24hours ago (or maybe a little longer) and it hit the [200k download in that time][1]! That’s a lot of bandwidth too! By my calculation, there is anywhere from 14.3 to roughly 195.3 Terabytes downloaded in 24 hours. Which, also by my calculations works out at about 1.3 to 18.5 Gigabits Per SECOND! That’s a lot! (see calculations below) Very cool, and well done!
