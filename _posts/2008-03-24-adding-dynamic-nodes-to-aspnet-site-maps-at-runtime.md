The at run time is very important! Check out this post over at Simons Software Stuff showing you[ how to Add dynamic nodes to ASP.NET site maps at runtime][1]. I can see this being extreamly handy. I have a small Content managment system for the photography site, and if i add extra pages, i have to manually edit the sitemap xml. with this, it could be automated! sweet!
