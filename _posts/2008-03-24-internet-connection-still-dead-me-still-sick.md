Ok. So my internet connection is not back up yet. unfortunitly. and i am still sick, which is a pain in the ass, but i have decided that neither of them will keep a good coder down! i am going to start hacking my own WordPress.NET app, which i have been talking about for a while. i am not totally sure how well this will work, but its worth a shot. i am hoping to get access again on monday. thats when NTL said they would try and fix the problem. if i get a chance i will post updates here.
