[the new ipod is here][1]. only 2 models now. the 20gb and 40gb. the 15 has died, and no word yet on the 60Gb. battery life is now at 12 hours, and now has the click wheel like the ipod mini. and a price drop. the 20Gb is $299 and the 40Gb is $399. I know the ipod mini looks good, but why on earth would you not pay the extra $50 to get 5x the amount of songs? weird. anyway, looks good.
