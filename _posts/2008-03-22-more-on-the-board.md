I know i have mentioned this a lot, but it looks like [The MSI K7D Master-L Mainboard][1] will be the one im getting. [Peats][2] have one of the [Tyan Tiger MP S2460][3] boards left and wont be getting in more. <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> So the MSI looks good. Found [this review][4] over at [Hard OCP][5] and it looks good. There are some weird things about memory, it will use one CPU, and doesent require 2 to load! wahoo! i can use my old Athlon till i get my MPs! Hmmmm. so, any thoughs? **[Update:]** [The Epox M762A][6] is an other option. sorry. just posting here so i know where they are too! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
