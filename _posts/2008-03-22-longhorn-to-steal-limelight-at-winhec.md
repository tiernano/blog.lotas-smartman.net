[Longhorn to Steal Limelight at WinHEC][1].  


> Microsoft is expected to recommend that the &#8220;average&#8221; Longhorn PC feature a dual-core CPU running at 4 to 6GHz; a minimum of 2 gigs of RAM; up to a terabyte of storage; a 1 Gbit, built-in, Ethernet-wired port and an 802.11g wireless link; and a graphics processor that runs three times faster than those on the market today. </p>
im hoping that a Dual 2Gz system will be classed as a dual core CPU running @ 4Gz! That being said, by the time Longhorn is released, we will all probably have something close to, or more powerfull then that sitting on or under our desks.
