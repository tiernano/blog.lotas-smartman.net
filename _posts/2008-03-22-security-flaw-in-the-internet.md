[This slashdot article][1] talks about a flaw in the cisco routers and switches that run the [IOS Operating System][2]. [Cert][3] have released [this advisory][4] and Cisco have released [this one][5] with some work arounds and stuff. Since a lot of the internet runs on cisco, this could be a major problem for a lot of ISPs. Fortunitly, my site is not big enough or financially stable enough for me to buy Cisco equipment. <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
