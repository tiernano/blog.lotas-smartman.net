[this site shows you how][1]. weird. i did this too. one of the things he states is that the Power supply has to be over 450 watts. thats weird. mine is 400 and its running grand. now maybe later on ill need a bigger one. also, he uses lower power chips then i did (i have 2 2400+ cpus, he has 2 1900+) but he mods them to run as dual chips too!
