[ActiveWin][1] have [This review][2] of [Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2003][3]. interesting read. i installed vs.net 2003 from the file on the [MSDN][4] on my 1.33gz athlon when it had 768mb ram and it took about half an hour. probably because i installed from disk. Anyway, when i get my [laptop][5], ill probably install win2k with VS6 and VS.net for testing. hehe! [updateded 17.57] the link was off slightly.
