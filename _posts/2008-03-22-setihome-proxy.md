Want to use a Seti@home proxy server thats fast? check out mine at [this address][1]. To use it with the command line client, which is faster then the screen saver, you use the switch -proxy lotas-smartman.net:5517. so if your client was named seti.exe, you would run seti.exe -proxy lotas-smartman.net:5517. If your using the screen saver, you can go to the settings and tell it to use the proxy lotas-smartman.net:5517. Stats and info is there. handy! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
