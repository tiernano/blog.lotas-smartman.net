i ment to post about this eriler on but never got a chance. Norton antivirus&#8217;s email scanner lost about 6000 of my emails last night! i downloaded the 6000+ emails uisng MailForward, like i talked about [yesterday][1] and norton cached them on the machine before sending them to the mail server. then for some reason, it couldent figure out where it was and gave up. it then deleted the emails and thats it! there gone! So, i dont know what was in them, but i just know there gone. Typical! i did manage to save about 10thousand emails that had not been downloaded by that stage. so, this morning i just killed nortons email scanning engine (since there is one on the exchange box anyway) and it downloaded what was left. Moral of the story? Never trust norton for your mail scanning, in or out going!
