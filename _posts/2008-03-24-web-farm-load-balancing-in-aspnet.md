3 things I have been interesting in for a while now are the ideas of Load Balancing, Redundancy, and Fail Over Clustering. Well, Check out this article from [C# Corner talking about Load Balancing][1], and what you have to do to get it to work properly in ASP.NET. The article talks about different techniques, like session management with SQL Server or State Server. While reading this, I remembered [Strange Loop Network&#8217;s AppScaler][2]. This is designed to work with ASP.NET Stuff without the need to worry about state management. it does it all. Now, if only I could get a Virtual Machine version of this&#8230;
