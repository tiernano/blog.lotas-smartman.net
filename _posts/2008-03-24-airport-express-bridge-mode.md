Airport Express has a feature called Bridge mode, which allows you to bridge the&nbsp;WIFI divide, or something like that. [Check out this article][1] talking about it, with info and links on how to set it up. Might be handy for making the shed wireless! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
