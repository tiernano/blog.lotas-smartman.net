A few days ago, i got an email from Elara telling me they had some HP Proliant servers quite cheap. How Cheap? [ML110][1], which is a dual core Xeon, 1Gb ram, 250Gb SATA HDD and onboard RAID&nbsp;for 160EUR! they also have the [ML115][2], an Dual core Opteron box, 512mb ram, and 160Gb hdd for 150EUR&#8230; neadless to day, i bought me the ML110. you can check out more photos at the flickr group below&#8230;

I was trying to get it to boot off the internal network, but building Windows Install Images using WAIK got me confused, so i just burned the DVD and installed it normally. So far, i have also upgraded the HDD (got a 500Gb for it, bring it to 750gb total) and i also ordered 4Gb more memory, to bring it to 5. it should be a nice Hyper-V host once the memory arrives&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
