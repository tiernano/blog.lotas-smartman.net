[New Microsoft Reader DRM 5 cracked with Convert Lit Version 1.4][1]. Good news, Fair Use boosters. The new DRM 5 from Microsoft has been cracked with Convert Lit 1.4. Other interesting Reader info appears, too, in Jerry Justiano&#8217;s essential [Pocket PC eBooks Watch][2].

A message here for the Microsoft and other powerful members of the [Open eBook Forum][3]? But of course. Forget about proprietary DRM schemes. Nonproprietary ones still won&#8217;t stop cracking, but at least they&#8217;ll help pave the way for a standardized e-book format at the consumer level&#8211;and *much* better sales figures.
