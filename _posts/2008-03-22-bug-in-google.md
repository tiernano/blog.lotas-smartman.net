[this article over at google weblog][1] talks about a bug in google. if a search has spam results, the spam result, and **the results after it** are removed. this meens that some searches like [Motorcycle Candle][2] and [keyboard bracelet][3] only return 1 result. [slashdot talked about this a few days back][4].
