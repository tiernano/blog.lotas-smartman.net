Right. im looking for memory for my imac and i cant find the bloody stuff. well i found some memory for it, but its quite confusing. it takes 144pin SO-DIMMS and no one seems to know what ones will work and what ones wont. its a pain in the ass. my [Retailer][1] has SO-DIMMS quite cheap, but no one seems to know if it will work or not. thats what i get for being part of a minority group! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> i cant wait till i get me the ram though. OSX would be sooo sweet!
