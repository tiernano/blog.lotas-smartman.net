[Ars Technica: USB 2.0 Hi-Speed drive review &#8211; Page 1 &#8211; (6/2003)][1]. interesting read. i especially like the [making a raid array from 2 drives][2]. I actually talked about making raid from floppies [before][3] and i remember thinking about using either USB keys or CF cards or something simular because of the speed of ram. and now someone tried it! ha! cool.
