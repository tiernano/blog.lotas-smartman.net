So, its been a while since i have posted anything here, so i better make this a good one&#8230;

[AirDisplay for the iPhone][1] and [iPad][1] is probably one of the coolest things i have bought on the iTunes store in a while! I have an [iPod Touch][2] (First Gen), an [iPad][3] (32Gb 3G) and an [iPhone 4][4] (16Gb). and i am using both the iPhone and iPad as external displays for my Laptop.

The way i am currently using it is quite cool. I use [Microsoft Visual Studio 2010][5] a lot of the time, so i have the output and Error list on the iPad. this allows me to have the main Visual Studio window open without extra clutter&#8230;

the only problem i am having with the app is that it wont allow me to have multiple external displays running at the same time&#8230; so, i cant have the iPad and iPhone running something&#8230; which is a pity, as it would be very handy&#8230;

Ideally, a second monitor would be handy, and if i where to get that, i could have the properties tab on the iPad, and a lot more on the external monitor&#8230;
