Right. [part 1][1] and [part 2][2] of the series of Retooling Slashdot with web standards got me thinking. im doing the same here on all my sites, but it may take a little longer. i like the idea of people being able to view my page in all browers, on phones, palm tops, etc, so im going to start a rebuild soon. hopefully, ill start tonight, but it may be some time after next wensday. i have my Java 1.2 Programmers Exam then. anyway, ill update any more info soon.
