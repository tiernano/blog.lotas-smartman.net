[this article][1] doesent make a lot of sence to me. i know i havent read it a lot, but whats the point of having a fast internet connection if your not going to use it to its full potential? Like my TV has 65 channels. i watch most of them., probably about 45 &#8211; 50. My PC runs @ 1.33Gz and im running [Seti@home][2] to make sure it works all the time. it never goes down for a sleep either! so why should my internet connection be limited?!
