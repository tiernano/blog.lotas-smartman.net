This is exactly what i was looking for! I just bought a license for [DigiGuide][1] and i like the reminders and favourites part of it, and i though &#8220;wouldent it be cool to get reminders on my phone or PDA?&#8221; then i found[DG2Outlook][2] which adds your favourites to your outlook calander, which i can then sync with my PDA or Smartphone! cool!
