[the register is reporting][1] that sun has released Solaris 8 and 9 for the x86 for free. the link to the sun site is [here][2]. i mentioned before that [solaris 10 was available free][3] for personal use. this is cool. going to try this on my machine for testing. probably under [VMware][4] or something.
