Ok. i have been concidering rewriting parts of the blog into ASP.NET, but this makes even more sence: Just downloading [.TEXT][1] and using that insted! I found [this interesting tool][2] for converting from an RSS feed to a .TEXT DB. I will post any tips i have when its complete, and you will know its done because of the new interface, etc. next question: Why? Well, .TEXT has a web service back end, and that means that i can build apps agenst the web service for my phone and pda, and also have multiple blogs running too. So, ill post more later.
