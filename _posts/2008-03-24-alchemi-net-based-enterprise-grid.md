Grid computing is one of those things that has me very interested. I suppose its because of the idea of using &#8220;Big Iron&#8221; to do a job, but not actually having a super computer in your possession. The only solution i ever found for Gird enabling applications is [DigiPede][1], but its not free, and not exactly cheap either for developing small non business related applications. Well, i found [Alchemi][2] (with the help of [DotNetKicks][3]) and it looks like it could be the answer to a problem i don&#8217;t actually have. now to find a&nbsp; reason to use this! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
