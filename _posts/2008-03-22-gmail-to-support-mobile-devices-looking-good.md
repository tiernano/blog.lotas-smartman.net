[Gmail to support mobile devices? Looking good!][1] I got my [Gmail][2] account on friday, and it works great. one thing i would like to see though is import of email from either pop3 or imap servers. I have LOADS of email on different servers, some imap, others pop3. then theres webmail, but lets not talk about that. i would love to see support for importing of email from hotmail, yahoo, pop3 accounts, etc. maybe theres already something i havent found. more searching needed. the feature to check your mail on a mobile device would be really sweet too.
