> Speaking of NokiaÃ¢â¬â¢s 9500 Communicator, the rumor going around is that they&#8217;re getting ready to introduce a smaller version called the 9300 next month that&#8217;ll still flip open to reveal a mini keyboard and widescreen LCD, but drop the WiFi and built-in digital camera (which honestly seems like a completely stupid move). Apparently they&#8217;ll still find a way to charge over eight hundred bucks for it though.</p>
