Ok. i just did some modifications to WordPress to enable RSS Enclosures, since it was not working last night for my podcast. [the info on making an enclosure in WordPress is here][1]. i will probably be posting an other podcast later today, or fairly shortly. i will see if i can get music working too. [update] yes it works! just checked with [Doppler][2] and its downloading as we speak!
