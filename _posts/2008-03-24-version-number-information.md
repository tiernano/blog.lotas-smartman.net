Jeff Atwood has a post on Coding Horror about [Version Numbers][1], and what they mean. He talks about Microsoft Office Version numbers, and explains what 12.0.4518.1014 means. Very interesting stuff. Also, as an added bonus, [this post over at Fear and Loathing][2] shows you how to get [NAnt][3] to use this idea when building, em, builds. Cool beans!
