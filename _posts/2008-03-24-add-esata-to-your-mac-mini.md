So, you bought a Mac Mini and your not happy with the speeds of the hard drive (its a 2.5&#8243; disk). Your also not happy with speeds of FireWire or USB2 drives. What do you do? [Add eSATA (External SATA, I think) to it][1]! This is interesting. I have been looking at the Mac Mini as a server, and adding eSATA to it would be extremely handy. Also, with the help of [iSCSI][2], all your storage could be external. one, fast eSATA drive for your mac mini, and the rest in a large server, and your sorted. You could have multiple Mac Minis in the same space as a regular server, and they aren&#8217;t that slow either&#8230; the standard spec is a dual core 1.66 with 512mb ram. you can up that to a Dual core 1.86Gz from apple, or really be a bit mad and install a [Core 2 Duo into it][3]&nbsp;and bring it up to dual core 2.33Gz and 64 bit&#8230; Hmmm, server&#8230;.</p>
