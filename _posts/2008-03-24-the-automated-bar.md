Now this is a cool idea: [the automated bar][1]. A computer controlled bar that has&nbsp;up to 16 different&nbsp;drinks, that can be mixed&nbsp;to make a drink of your choice! How cool is that?! And&nbsp;its written in VB! You could hack this to add web services&nbsp;so you can order drinks using your phone, or your media center for that matter! You could log what you drink, and who drank what (its pin based) so you can find out who&nbsp;what the&nbsp;most drank drink is, etc. so may ideas! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
