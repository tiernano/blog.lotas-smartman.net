[Robert Levy is talking about the new device emulator on the windows mobile blog][1]. some of the new features include built in screen rotation and full emulation of the ARM processor, so now when your testing, you dont build an x86 version of your app first, debug and then build an arm version, you do your debugging on the arm copy! this is very cool. im going to start work on some software for the PPC and Smartphone, and VS2005 looks really sweet!
