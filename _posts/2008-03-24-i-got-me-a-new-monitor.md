I just got my hands on a new 17&#8243; flat planel monitor. man this this is sweet! its a liteon K17AN and it is really nice to look at. i have my original 17&#8243; CTR pluged into a PCI graphics card, and its being used as a second display. and not only that, the flat screen uses so little space, my desk is now free to get even more <strike>junk</strike> interesting stuff on! photos will be up soon. [update] The photos are now [here][1]. enjoy!
