<a href=\"http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/orange\_gives\_free\_bike\_with\_new\_plans.php\">Gizmodo are reporting that Orange</a>, a mobile operator in Europe, are offering a free bike when you sign up for a 30EUR a month service. The bike has a cradle for the phone so you can charge it when oyur on the go, and the phone will be bluetooth enabled with a headset so you can talk and bike to work. Cool idea! Thats one way to keep your phone charged!
