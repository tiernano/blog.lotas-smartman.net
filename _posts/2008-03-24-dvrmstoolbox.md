Now this is a cool thing. [DVRMSToolbox][1] is a suite of tools that allows you to do the following:

  * Convert DVR-MS files to MPEG-2 
      * Convert DVR-MS files to MPEG-2 without Commercials 
          * Convert DVR-MS files to WMV (audio and video) 
              * Convert DVR-MS files to WMV without Commercials 
                  * Convert DVR-MS files to WMA (audio only) 
                      * Edit DVR-MS files and save directly back to DVR-MS 
                          * and much more!
                        Very cool stuff. I like the idea of ripping out the ads, converting to a different format, etc. I will be playing with this later tonight! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Hopefully you can set the size of the WMV (for the PPC&#8230;)
