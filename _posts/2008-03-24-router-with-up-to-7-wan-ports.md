The [Linksys RV016][1] has a total of 16 ports. 7 of them can act as internet load balancing ports! it will also support up to 50 VPN connections. There is also the [RV042][2], which has 2 WAN ports and 4 LAN ports, which is handy and i have found a place here in Ireland selling these! i want one! There is a [RV082][3] which has 2 WAN, 8 LAN and 50 VPN connections. The RV042 has 30 VPN connections, but i dont think i need that much. anyway, if i got the one with 7 WAN connections, thats a total of 10.5Mb/s down (with 7 1.5 cable modems!) and 1.75mb/s upload! now that would be sweet! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
