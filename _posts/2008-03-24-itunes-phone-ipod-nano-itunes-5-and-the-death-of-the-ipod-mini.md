Ok. Apple made their big announcement today. First things first. the [iTunes phone][1]. [and so what?!][2]. This is one of those things thats just too late. Sorry Apple. the Windows Smartphone and Pocket PC Phone has been doing this for quite some time! next: the [iPod nano][3]. now this looks nice. 2 and 4Gb (no Hdd). very small, and most importantly, comes in black and white! i want a black one! The nano will replace the mini, which is now dead&#8230;.
