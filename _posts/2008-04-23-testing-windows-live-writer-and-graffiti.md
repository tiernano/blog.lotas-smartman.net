Right, after moving to Graffiti, Windows Live Writer was not working. And this morning [Robert Sweetnam][1] emailed me telling me my RSS feeds with feed burner where screwed. links where being sent to my internal server name, not blog.lotas-smartman.net. After a bit of tweaking with ISA, i fixed the problem. For Graffiti to work correctly, it needs the full URL. I will, eventually, write up something more substantial on the fix and how i am using ISA 2006 as my front end soon, but for now i will leave it as is. its working now, after all! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
