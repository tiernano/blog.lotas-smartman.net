<a href=\"http://news.com.com/2100-1015_3-5171944.html\">News.com are reporting</a> that Hitachi are to release a 400Gb hdd by the end of the year. it runs at 7200RPM, which is normal, but i havent seen a lot of the larger drives come out first at that speed. they usually start at 5400 and then move to 7200 after a few months. this now makes it a max of 1.6TB of space with just 2 IDE controlers! imagine all the <strike>mp3s</strike> i mean legal downloads, you could get on that! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
