So, yesterday Apple and EMI announced [DRM free downloads on the iTunes music store][1]. One of the things about this announcement is that the DRM Free songs will be encoded at 256k/s, not the current 128k/s. this means that if you fill your 80Gb iPod with DRM Free songs from iTunes, not only will it cost you a staggering $13,000, but it will also mean you only get 10,000 songs, not the current 20,000. I suppose this just now means apple will want to release a 100Gb iPod fairly shortly after. 

But anyway, i suppose my next question is about when will the TV studios and Movie industry decide to do the same? i recently got my hands on a $100 US iTunes gift card, and have being buying TV shows with it. Thing is, i cant watch them on my 32&#8243; TV with the 5.1 audio because i cant get it to stream to the XBox360, and i wont be buying an [Apple TV][2] just for that. 

ideally, if we could get them in DRM Free mode too (say for $2.50 a pop), even at their current quality, or in 720p HD quality, converting them to play on other devices (Pocket PC, XBox360, Smartphone or PSP) would not be a trivial thing to do. If only it where that easy. some how i think Hollywood have their heads up in asses, so i don&#8217;t think it will happen soon, but please prove me wrong!
