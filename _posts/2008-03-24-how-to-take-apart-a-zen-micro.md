Right, about a year and a half ago, <a class href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/archive/2005/10/02/12078.aspx">i bought a Zen Micro</a>. Its a 6Gb, and it was used quite a lot. since then i have gotten a 30Gb&nbsp;Zune and a 60Gb iPod video, so 6Gb is not exactly usefull for music. So, today, i figured out something: The Zen has a CF hard disk in it, and my Camera takes a CF Card. can you see where im going here? <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> So, check out <a class href="http://www.hardwarezone.com/articles/print.php?cid=9&id=1331">this article showing you how to take it apart</a> (which i will be trying later). Hopefully this works well! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
