[Aperture 1.1][1] has been released. It is now a Universal Binary, so it will run on an Intel mac and a PowerMac, and also the price has droped to a very interesting $299. One issue i have seen: the [Intel Mac Mini][2] will not run it. not enough power, so i will be getting my Intel powered [MacBook Pro][3], just to play with this&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
