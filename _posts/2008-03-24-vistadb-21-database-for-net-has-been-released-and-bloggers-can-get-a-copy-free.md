This post is a semi advert. for posting this, i can get a copy of VistaDB, which sounds very interesting. i have a lot of ideas for applications that are limited by the DB. MSDE is huge, and i dont like having to post 80mb+ files to my server! This could be the solution. if i get my copy i will post some demo apps with it, and some experiances! sweet use of viral marketing! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
