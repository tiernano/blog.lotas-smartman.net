Check out [this article over at Daves iPaq][1].&nbsp;iPod Shuffle VS a Sandisk MP3 Player. interesting read. i like the sound of the sandisk mp3 player already, since it plays MP3s, WMAs and DRMed WMAs. also, with a radio and sound recorder, it sounds even better. only one problem: No line in. which would have been very nice to have. i could have my mic pluged into the external Sound Blaster Audigy 2 NX, and it connected to my machine via USB, and anything that played on the computer would come though that. then have the headphones connection into the MP3 player/voice recorder, and headphones pluged into that. now to find something else that has a gig of storage for the same kind of price.
