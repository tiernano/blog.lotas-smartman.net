[Build Mozilla Thunderbird on Microsoft Windows][1]. Henrik Gemal writes: Build Mozilla Thunderbird in 14 easy steps! I&#8217;ve written a recipe on how to build build Mozilla Thunderbird on Microsoft Windows. No need for any Microsoft Visual C++ stuff. Just plain gcc and mingw. Sounds like fun! Also check out some of the other cool Mozilla stuff&#8230; [[Blogzilla &#8211; a blog about Mozilla][2]] handy but i would like to see it for the whole mozilla or the browser. thunderbird is the mail client, firebird is the web browser, i think.
