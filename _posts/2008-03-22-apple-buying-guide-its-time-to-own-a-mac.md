[this osnews article][1] talks about what macs to buy if your in the market. they go though the good and bad points for the emac, ibook and powermac g4. it is the perfect time to move to a mac. im not going to be a full switcher. im getting an imac as an extra on my network. i have a dual athlon running Linux, i have a duron 700 running linux, i will have a K6-2 450 and a Athlon 1.3Gz running linux and then the iMac as something to play with, as something new. sweet. i would love an emac, but cant get one cause im quite broke!
