Im robbing from the (memory) rich and giving to the (memory) poor! i have my windows laptop, which has 768mb ram (a 256mb dimm and a 512mb dimm) and i have the powerbook with a single 256mb dimm. so, cheating, i **Borrowed** the 256mb dimm from the Dell and put it in the powerbook. and i was right! Macs do like lots of ram. this is a LOT faster. now to upgrade the mac to 768mb and put the 768 back into the Dell&#8230;
