AMD [Announced][1] 2 new opterons. a 146 for single chip mances (running at 2Gz i think) and the 846 (running @ the same speed) but for 4 &#8211; 8 way systems. Yea, i think its 2Gz casue the [248 talked about here][2] runs at 2.2Gz. That makes sence. though why the single chip running slower? Hmmmm.
