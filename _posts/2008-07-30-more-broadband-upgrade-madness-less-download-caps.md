So, in the last couple of months, its been a broadband war here. First, [UPC upgrade their top connections to 20Mb][1]. Then [Magnet upgrade theirs to 50Mb][2], mind you only&nbsp; a handfull of people can actually get it&#8230; And today, [BT have upgraded theirs to 24Mb][3]! But one very nice piece about all this: BT and UPC have removed their download caps. With all the malarkey going on in the States with companies adding download caps and charing an arm and a leg for overage charges, its starting to look like Europe are moving forward, and the US are moving backwards&#8230;
