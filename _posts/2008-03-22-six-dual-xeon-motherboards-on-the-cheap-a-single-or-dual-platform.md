[Six Dual Xeon Motherboards on the Cheap &#8211; A Single Or Dual Platform?][1] Cool article. its 29 pages long, and has lots of photos of mother boards. Now its started to make me think of whats my next system? Opteron or Xeon? or what ever Intels 64bit processor is going to be? 64Bit is probably going to be the next big thing, so ill look for that. might be a while though&#8230;
