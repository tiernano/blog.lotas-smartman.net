Right. [the UK has just accepted the European Union Copyright Directive][1]. this is a pretty evil law. Ok, i understand the idea that uploading to a P2P network is illegal, but they also make it illegal to back up cds to mp3, mp3 player, or an other CD. Same with DVDs. a link to the law its self is [here][2]. i dont know what other countries are currently using this, but hopefully ireland isent one of them. this is rediculous! is making a copy of a cd you own for the car not fair use? turning it into MP3 is just an electronic version of the same. bit stupid dont you think?
