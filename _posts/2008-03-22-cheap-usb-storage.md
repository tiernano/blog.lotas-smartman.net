[Teeny, cheap USB storage][1]. <img height=91 src="http://craphound.com/images/teenyusbfob.jpg" width=116 align=left> This teeny-ass USB storage-fob holds 128MB and retails for $37. John Gilmore has a great rant about storage cost/size/capacity/power-consumption trends &#8212; he says that in 10 years, we&#8217;ll have drives the size of sugar-cubes with enough capacity to store all the movies, books, music, art and text ever created, that can be powered by a hard shake and are cheap enough to put in a Christmas Stocking.
