Ok. i want to create an ASP.NET backend to WordPress. this is mainly for posting stuff to the site using an XML web service, so i can post using the phone or PDA or a smart client somewhere. some problems with this though. the wordpress SQL database is quite strange! i still havent fully figured it out yet. also, im trying to figure out security with this, so thats also confusing. i am hoping to play around with it a bit more over the next few days. hopefully i will have something to show for it then!
