Waheay!!! The Internet in here is now fast! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> they just got a 1mb line and I.m getting about the same speed as my connection at home a lot of the time. I was downloading something yesterday with it at 111Kbytes/s!! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> I think the max I got so far was about 120k. So, it.s July too. Independence day is coming up soon. So, I.ll post something about that about the time it.s coming up. Anyway, I got Windows XP running on my machine last night and I.m trying to rip a DVD, purely for speed testing. Its one of those promo DVDs with trailers and stuff. I keep encoding the first 30seconds of a trailer and then stops. I think there.s about 8 trailers in a row at each are about 2 min. so of the 16min, it.s encoding about 30 sec. It.s not fair. I think I was hitting about 20 . 25FPS when it was running. Not bad. Think that works about nearly real time. That meens if I did encode a full film I could do it in about 2 hours, not the 24 hours it took the [AMD][1] K6-2 450 I had before. Now if only I could get me a [multi-threading][2] [DivX][3] Encoder&#8230;&#8230;
