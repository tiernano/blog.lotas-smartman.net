[Apple opens Ginza store; Osaka store coming in 2004][1]. Apple Computer Inc. opened its first retail store in Japan, and the first outside the U.S., to journalists Thursday ahead of its official opening this Sunday. The store, in the ritzy Ginza shopping district of Tokyo, covers five floors and includes a theater that can seat 84 people, a help desk and a classroom in addition to retail space. It will sell Apple&#8217;s complete line of computers and peripherals, as well as a handful of products from other vendors, such as printers, scanners and digital cameras. [[MacCentral][2]] hope one of these come to Ireland soon
