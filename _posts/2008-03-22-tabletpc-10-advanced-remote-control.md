I posted [this link][2] a few days ago on how to use a standard graphics tablet to turn your PC into a tablet PC. now, you can use your pocket pc to turn your pc into a tablet pc. i have to try this out when my axim arives! and the code is included too so you can modify it or see how its done! Dont forget to vote for it though! if anything i have seen on the site deserves a free PDA, that does! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
