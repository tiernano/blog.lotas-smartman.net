God forbid this would happen, but it can. [this site][1] has some usefull tips. and the idea of that AOL cd thingy is funny. i have had some scary moments when my net connection has died for about 2 &#8211; 10 minutes and im quite board. my remidy for this is coffee. go down stairs, get coffee and then your up all night messing on the web. which is handy. if its down for more then a few min, i have my mobile. 9.6k dialup is better then nothing <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
