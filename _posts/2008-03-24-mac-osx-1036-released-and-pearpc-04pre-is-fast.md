Firsltly [Mac minuite are reporting that OSX 10.3.6 has been released][1]. i havent installed it yes, because i dont have enough bandwidth! Secondly, [OSnews are reporting that PearPC 0.4Pre is actually faster then some hardware macs!][2]. I have downloaded it, and im going to start playing with it and see if this is true. i have never actually gotten PearPC to work before, so i will see what happens. I will hopefully post laster when i find out if it works.
