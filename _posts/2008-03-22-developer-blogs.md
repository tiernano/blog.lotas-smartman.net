Im looking at the idea of running a developer blogs page. What i meen by this is i will run blogs for developers on my site using [Movabletype][1] and the developers just post to it. it will be hosted on the [LSDN][2] and will be free under certin conditions (i.e. ads on the site) if you would like a developer blog, please [Email me][3] and we can arrange stuff.
