[MS Exchange 2000 Articles and Tutorials][1]. Cool site with losts of stuff on Exhange 2000, 2003 and 5.5. Im linking to the 2000 stuff mainly because thats what im trying to get running on that win2k server i got up and running on my network. theres an article [here entitled &#8220;Hosting Your Own SMTP Mail Using Exchange 2000&Prime;][2] which should help a lot. i got my exchange box connecting to outlook (or the other way around) and it can send email to the web, and from my self, but not yet get it from the internet. looks like it could be a busy weekend!
