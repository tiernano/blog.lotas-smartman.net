Right. check out [this review at monster hardware][1] of the dell AXIM X5 Pocket PC 2002. this looks like a pretty cool peice of hardware. not only do they review it well, and give a good idea, then overclock it to 398Mhz (up from 300mhz as the standard chip). no thinking the 300Mhz model is 100quid or so cheaper then the 400 and then 400 has an extra 32mb ram, and crucial have [256mb Compact Flash cards][2] @ under &euro;70, thats not bad at all. the software that overclocks the Axim, [pocket hack master][3] is not free though. cant get a price for it yet though either. still. i would like very much. that and the wireless card. thats an other 75 euro. hmmmm and bluetooth. sweet.
