right. there may be some down time on the network over the cource of the weekend. this is due to a few things. a reorginization of the server cables, network cables, etc. also a reinstall of the server OS. this is due to redhat 8.0 having decided to partition my system the way it wanted to, and not the way i wanted to. Also, i need to setup a different copy of apache, probably a newer version. i may stick with [Redhat][1], i may move somewhere else. All will be revealed soon. i will have a server up and running, but probably not functioning 100%. i will have my workstation running as a backup server. so, ill post more. this is your warning!
