You know the world is different   
when the best rapper is a white guy,   
the best golfer is a black guy,   
the tallest guy in the NBA is Chinese,   
the Swiss hold the America&#8217;s Cup,   
France is accusing the US of arrogance,   
Germany doesn&#8217;t want to go to war,   
and the 3 most powerful men in America   
are named &#8216;Bush&#8217;, &#8216;Dick&#8217;, and &#8216;Colon&#8217;!&#8221;
