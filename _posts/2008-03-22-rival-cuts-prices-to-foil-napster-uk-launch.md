[Rival cuts prices to foil Napster UK launch][1]. this OD2 place actually is pretty cool. But napster rocks even more. The idea that you pay $9.99 (i think, but thats US price) and can listen to unlimited songs streamed over the web is pretty cool. Im always online at home and in work, so why not use that! pretty sweet. I have to try this out! More on the napster launch: [Napster Prepares for UK Launch with Indie Deal][2].
