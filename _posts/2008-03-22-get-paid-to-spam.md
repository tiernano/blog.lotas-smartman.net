[Slashdot are talking about a company][1], [VirtualMDA][2] who are paying users to allow them to use your computer to send email. $1 an hour. dont get me wrong, but $1 an hour seems like a lot. like its costing me EUR30 a month to run my site. google pays though ads, but its not a lot. im not going to try it, but a lot of people probably will. we need someone with more money and sense to make an app that pays users $2 an hour to classify spam as spam and make a large database for blocking it. [Cloudmark][3] does a great job, but its not free. they should have an option for the more spam you find and classify, the chepaer or more free the product becomes. a lot of people would get free spam killing software then!
