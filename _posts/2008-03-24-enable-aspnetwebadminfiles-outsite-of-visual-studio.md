one of the things i nearly always have a problem with when building ASP.NET 2.0 sites is the membership section. I can create users, but they end up on my local machine, and when i publish to a server, i cant login. Well, i found a solution. Jedatu has a post explaining <a class href="http://www.jedatu.com/techblog/2005/12/enable-aspnetwebadminfiles-outside.html">how to enable connecting to this outside of VS2005</a>. Very cool stuff!
