Right, so a few links before I disappear for the St Patrick&#8217;s Day Festivities&#8230; 

First, Joe on .NET has a post with [65 links to make you an expert in Windows Communications Foundation][1]. I am OOF this week, so I will try and learn something, and WCF is one of the things I want to learn.

Next, [MobileBlogPoster][2] is rising from the ashes! I am in the process of checking the code, which was lost from [CodePlex][3], back into their TFS instance. I am currently tracking the issue [here][4]. I am also working on some extra features, which will include Amazon S3 support!

Finally [FlexiScale][5]. I [talked about these guys before][6], but now it looks like their [API][7] is up and running, allowing you create machines on demand and also start and stop them as you please. I have requested access to this, as it seems my username and password does not work on their API. I was playing around with it last night, and setup a small VPN between my iPhone and my server over there. Works very nicely! I have to play around a lot more with it.
