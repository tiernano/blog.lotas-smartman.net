[this post over at FrieK&#8217;s blog has some interesting info about EM64T and AMD64][1]. its mainly telling you some of the differences. interesting read none the less. and in a non related post, just because i found this on the same [blogs.msdn.com][2] main feed, [the virtual PC Guy trys out Windows Media Center Edition 2005 on Virtual PC][3] and has some interesting luck with it. The biggest thing thats making me want to play with Media Center is the TV support. unfortunitly i have an unsupported TV Card. i really want a media center PC though. it would go well with my flat panel monitor. and i have the hardware, except for the tv card. Hmmmm. wonder where i left the credit card&#8230;
