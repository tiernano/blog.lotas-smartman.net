[check out this forum post][1] on how to burn dvds on linux. im testing it at the moment by burning a dvd with mp3s on it for work tomorrow. currently burning @ 2.4x which is the limitation of DVD+RW burning of the drive. It will burn + and -R discs at 4X, +RW&#8217;s @ 2.4 and -RWs at 2. it will also run CDRs at 24 and CDRWs at 10. And i found out it will do HD-CDs which allows me to get 1.4Gb of data on a 700mb cdr! and it will burn 99min cds too! this is sweet. now to get it to do hd-cds under linux&#8230;
