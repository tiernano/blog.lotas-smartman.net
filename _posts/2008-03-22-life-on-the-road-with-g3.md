[Life on the Road with 3G &#8211; NewMobileComputing.com][1]. Interesting. it says its not really G3 but G2.5, or GPRS in other words. i have this my self and its quite good. Very handy actually! i read the news all the way to the shops today, putting the phone in my pocket, locked, a few times becasue of crossing the road or what have you, and never had to disconnect! great! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
