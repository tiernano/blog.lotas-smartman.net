Engadget are reporting that DVD Jon, the guy who cracked the DVD encryption, has found a way of [buying non DRMed music from the iTunes music store][1]! The software you use is called PyMusique. If you buy music from the iTunes music store at the moment, its only DRMed after its downloaded to your machine. what this does is downloads the music, but &#8220;forgets&#8221; to put the DRM in. Very interesting idea. The PyMusique site is running very slow at the moment, but it sounds interesting. wonder how long this will last&#8230;
