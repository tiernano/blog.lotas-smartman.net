[Toms hardware][1] has this to say *NETGEAR&#8217;s WG602 54Mbps Wireless Access Point is its first draft-802.11g Access Point, and the first draft-11g product I&#8217;ve reviewed that&#8217;s based on Intersil&#8217;s PRISM GT chipset. I found it to have significant differences from the Broadcom-based Buffalo Technology and Linksys products that I&#8217;ve previously looked at &#8212; some good, some not so good. * Im in the market for an 802.11g wireless net card and access point. check out [this review][2].
