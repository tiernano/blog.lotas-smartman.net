[Full story here][1]. Original read [here][2]. Quick parts of it: *MS announced in a press release that a public beta would be available on April 15th, but it is not there yet, but a beta build leaked to the ms-beta newsgroup.</p> 

Microsoft Virtual Server enables enterprises with large server clusters to reduce the amount of physical machines by running multiple virtual servers on each. Microsoft plans to also position Virtual Server as a migration path for businesses still running Windows NT4 servers, which can be consolidated onto a newer machine running Windows Server 2003.

The leaked build is numbered 1.0.218 and retains the Connectix logo. It integrates with Internet Information Services to offer administration of virtual servers via the Web and features a remote control client. The beta release expires on October 15, 2003</i>
