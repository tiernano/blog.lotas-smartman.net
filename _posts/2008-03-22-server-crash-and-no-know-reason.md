Right. the server died this morning some time. checking logs, and theres no reason i can find why. also, my workstation crashed! got a BSOD for the first time on a windows XP box! it crashed about 10min before i make this post. i checked the logs for that one. but i dont know what the hell happened with the linux box. ISA was returning 404 errors. weird! that started this morning, but hopefully everything is working grand now&#8230;
