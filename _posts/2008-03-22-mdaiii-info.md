[Engadget has some info on T-Mobiles new MDAIII][1] which should be comming out soon, but who knows! its got 128mb memory, digital camera, bluetooth and a slide down thump QWERTY keyboard! pretty cool. bit more info [here too][2]. Wonder when O2 will get their hands on this. the MDA1 and MDA2 are O2&#8217;s XDA and XDA2 i think, so this should also be an XDA3? Ohhh, and it has wifi! just like the XDA2. too lazy to find out if the XDA and MDA are the same just rebadged.
