[this article over at hollywood reporter][1] wants region coding on DVDs to be removed. he says this causes more chances for pirates to make money. one thing about this idea though. he talks about &#8220;Finding Nemo&#8221;. it was released on DVD on Nov 5th, but was only released in cinemas about then here in Ireland. if you could get the DVD, region coding or not, in the US, would you not be better off getting the DVD insted of going to the cinema? i know i would! it would meen that films would have to be released at the same time world wide, which would make sence for a lot of people, and DVDs too.why pay 8EUR for a cinema ticket for 2 or 3 friends to watch a film in a cinema where you cant pause it or watch it multiple times, when you can buy it for about the same price and watch it as many times as you want?!
