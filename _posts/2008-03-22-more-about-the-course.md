Right. so i was out in [Fas][1] today for my induction on the cource im doing out there. Its pretty cool. I do a Microsoft Sertification course on VB. Not sure the number. cant find it on the MS site. The MS training site is [here][2]. So i will be doing VB, Java, and i become java certified IF i pass the exam, same with the VB one! and also i do HTML, XML, and a few others too. should be pretty cool! Ohhh, i still havent managed to fix the site yet. working kind of but still a bit off. sorry.
