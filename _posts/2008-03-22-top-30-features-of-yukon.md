<a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/sql/yukon/productinfo/top30features.asp\">the top 30 features of yukon</a>, or MSSQL Server 2005 as it will be known, has been released on the Microsoft web site. pretty cool stuff. i have to dig out my copies of Virtual PC, Windows 2003 server (i have a 180 day trial somewhere, and if not, its downloadable i think of the MS Site) and get the demo or beta of Yukon. Yeah. Windows 2003 server 180 day trial is <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/evaluation/trial/evalkit.mspx\">here</a> and Yukon is not available to download. Hmmmm. well i still want to play with win2k3 server.
