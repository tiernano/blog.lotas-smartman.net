[Building a Super Tiny Home Server][1]. Now thats cool. though, if that was me, i would be installing Windows 2003 Server, not XP Pro. reason? XP Pro has a limit of 10 connections to the file server at one time and same with the Web Server. it might not be a major problem at the start, but it could become one soon!
