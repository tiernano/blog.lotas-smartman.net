In the early hours of this morning, i finally moved my SQL server instance off my fairly over loaded Poweredge, to my 64bit Dual Opteron. This should now mean the site is a LOT more responsive. hopefully you will notice this. As a further note, i am Out of the country over the weekend (From tomorrow morning at 8am till sometime Monday) so there will be no posts. Once i get back, i will start looking into moving the site to a different blogging engine, since Community Server is a little too big for my needs!
