Ok. sorry for the downtime. the server has finally moved, both physically, and softwarelly (if thats a word). I have moved the box into the new home in the comms closet. i have also moved the website and database over to my PowerEdge mainly because of the many crashes the other machine was having and also because of the extra speed in the poweredge (2.4Gz HT Xeon VS 700Mhz Duron). Theres more ram, and upgradibility, so its an easy choice. anyway, hopefully we get no more crashes!
