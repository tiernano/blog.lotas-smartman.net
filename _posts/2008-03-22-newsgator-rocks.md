<div class="Section1">
  <p>
    I have just installed <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/">Newsgator</a> on my system with a copy of Outlook XP and I&rsquo;m just blown away by its Coolness! And I got a plug-in to allow me post from it to WordPress instantly. Scoble was talking about a <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/03/23.html#a7079">Magic Folder for Outlook</a> to allow him post stuff instantly from Outlook. He got one, but it only works with Outlook 2003. But Newsgator has a plug-in to post to B2/Wordpress. Sweet. And not only that, but it now has spell check, HTML posting (like copying from a page, with links, and post directly to this. Links and all!). The spell checker is handy because I&rsquo;m useless at spelling! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> Anyway, the last few posts have been posted with it and so is this one.
