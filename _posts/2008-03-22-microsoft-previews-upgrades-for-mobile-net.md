<a href=\"http://www.idevnews.com/IntegrationNews.asp?ID=105\">Microsoft Previews Upgrades for Mobile .NET</a>. Lots of stuff about the .NET CF (Compact Framework) V2. Its faster then the last release, and has some sweet extra features.  


> This week, Microsoft will release its first upgrade to its .NET Compact Framework, bringing mobile developers more performance, more UI support and a raft of new access technologies to make it easier for devs to integrate mobile devices with a wide array of XML, SQL and COM resources on legacy apps and databases</p>
