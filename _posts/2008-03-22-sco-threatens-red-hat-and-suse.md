[Slashdot | SCO Threatens Red Hat and SuSE][1]. Havent been able to read the article cause the site has been <a hreg="http://godonlyknows.lotas-smartman.net/?q=slashdotted">Slashdotted</a> but hopefully it will be back soon. Its a scary though, but i hope IBM can though a lot of loyers at them. from [this reply][2] and the [one before it][3] it looks weird. lets hope this works well for the linux guys! im not running win2k or win2k3 on my server! too expencive and hardware intencive!
