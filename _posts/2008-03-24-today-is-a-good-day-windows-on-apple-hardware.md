Today is an extreamly good day! Well, it was yesterday, but i was waiting for confirmation. The competition to try and get [Windows booting on an Intel powered Mac][1] has been won, and it works! I love the mac hardware, its just georgous! but OSX has its problems, and i do 90% (if not more) of my work in Windows. Now that this is confirmed, i still like the look of the [Mac mini][2], and its now on my wish list. And, i definatly like the look of the new [MacBook pro][3] too&#8230;
