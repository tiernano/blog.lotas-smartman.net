Ok. im moving the server off site, well actually the contents of the server, to a new hosting company later on today. i have noticed the site is quite slow over the last while and im not sure why. the webserver is a dual athlon 2gz and the sql server is a 1.3Gz athlon. Anyway, if it makes a major speed increese, i may just keep it there. saves me the bother of administrating it at home. but i dont know. i like running my own servers at home. i will see later. anyway, ill tell you when it happens. i hope to have it done with out anyone noticing! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
