[this article][1] over at apple insider talks about the idea that apple could be releasing a copy of iTunes for windows. now, although the music store is not available outsite the US, yet, [iTunes][2] looks pretty sweet. they reckon about October 16th.  


> Numerous sources have recently [pointed][3] to a mid-October release for the Windows compatible version of the company&#8217;s iTunes software and online music store. However, additional surprises could be in store.</p>
and in more internet news, [Napster][4] has a new site, and is offering 5 free songs if you sign up now. only problem is you have to put in credit card details to get your 5 songs and you probably have to be in the US. pricing is pretty good and on par with iTunes @ 99c per song or $9.99 for an album. Looks good.
