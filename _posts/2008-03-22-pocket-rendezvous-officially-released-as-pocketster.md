[Pocket Rendezvous Officially Released as &#8216;Pocketster&#8217;][1]. cool P2P File sharing (well, kind of) on a PPC. this could be cool for coffee bars and places with free wifi or cheap wifi connections. now with the advant of Starbucks opening soon in Ireland, which will hopefully have wifi, it could be a lot cooler for getting free songs or what have you.
