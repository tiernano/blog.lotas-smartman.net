[AppleInsider | Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger to sport updated Finder, .Mac integration][1]. Still no news on the idea of home on an iPod. thats something i would like to see on a windows PC too! how cool would it be to be able to bring your desktop, email, documents, favourites, etc home and to work on one device?
