Ok, this is a weird one for you: [Adding an LCD screen to your mouse][1]. i have seen some weird things in my time, but this one is very weird. mind you, i could see a use for it. Cool stuff! I am wondering if you could get a higher Res screen, which more colors and faster refersh rate (this one is about 132\*132 with 4096 colors). If you could get, lets say, the screen from a Smartphone at 176\*220 or even the higher res QVGA Screens, you could use it for displaying more stuff, like photos, video, what ever. with PPC screens (if you can get them to do touch screen on your PC) the posibilities are endness! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
