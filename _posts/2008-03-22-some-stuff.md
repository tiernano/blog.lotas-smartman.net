Ok. so i have some stuff to post here. firstly, check out [RLX][1]. they have some pretty cool looking server blades. one of them has a Dual Xeon 3Gz in it! you can fit 10 of these blades into a 6U enclosure. thats 70 in a 42U Rack. Thats 140 CPU&#8217;s with about 560Gb of Ram and what ever hard drive space is included in them X 70. not sure about full stats of these. havent had a chance to get around to looking properly. Also my bluetooth adapter works from down stairs. checked this morning. not very fast in the sitting room, takes about 8 -10 seconds to send a 34k picture, but faster in the kitchen, about 2 seconds. will test internet access in these rooms. found out how to do internet though the bluetooth too. My PC is connected though cable, as you know, and i can access the internet being routed though the PC! wahoo! 512k internet access on a mobile phone. works in the kitchen as i said and my bed too! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> final thing. [CSS Colour][2] chart. Very handy. Finaly, and this time i meen it, check out [My CV][3] in XML. Also the XSL is [here][4]. havent goten it working in anything other then IE 6 on win2k. Opera wont work. not sure about Mozilla. havent tested it yet. will soon.
