Ok. i just found a new 80mm fan for my workstation, and due to the heat producted by it i am going to be adding this soon. probably in about an hour or so. it shouldent take any more then a half hour to get up and running, due to soldering and stuff, but hopefully it wont take too long. actually, it could take a lot less, but we will see&#8230;
