[movabletype 3.0][1] has just been released, and what does it mean to me? Well, nothing! It cost money now. theres a free copy with 1 author and 3 blogs (which in theory would be great for me since i only really run one main blog here) but when i used Movabletype, i found it too cumbersome. I like wordpress. im not going back!!
