[the msn search blog has some info about RSS feeds in MSN results][1]! Thats cool. one thing i would like though, if posible, is to tell it how many results you want. i am thinking of this more along programming lines so you could tell it to get a result set from 1 &#8211; 100, cache that on your site, use it which ever way (im guessing there will be a license or something to use this) and then if you need from 101-200, you can ask the server for that too. Even not using it that way, its really handy. Actually, i just found you can get new that way too! Check out [this feed for the latest Tsunami Relief news][2] or [this one for Microsoft news][3].
