[Pascal][1] commented on [my last post][2] about my comments not working great with IE6. I also noticed some issues with IE7&#8230; It think its the way my network here is setup. it maybe something with do with [ISA server][3] caching some of the Javascript files, or the way [SimpleCDN][4] is serving them&#8230; Either way, i dont like running my own comments. Things get messy, u have to manage spam, etc. So, i have just outsourced my comments to run with the guys at [Disqus.com][5]. Scott Watermasyst has a post on his site showing you [how to get Graffiti and Disqus working together][6]. Since the site is powered by Graffiti, i was very happy to use this. i wont know untill i post this if it works, but hopefully all is good&#8230; comment (if they work) on any issues you see&#8230;
