[America&#8217;s Army 2.0 now available for Mac, Linux][1]. As MacCentral [first reported yesterday][2], today marks the release of America&#8217;s Army: Special Forces, a new version of the recruiting tool/computer game produced by the U.S. Army. The game is now available from links on the America&#8217;s Army Web site, both as an updater for existing 1.9 users and also as a full version download. [[MacCentral][3]] hmmm. available for linux too. have to try that. had it on windows but it was slow. now i have a more optimized kernel, it should be pretty fast.
