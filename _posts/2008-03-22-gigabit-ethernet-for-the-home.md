[Slashdot are being asked about GigaBit Ethernet for the home][1]. this is an interesting question. i was thinking of upgrading sections of my network to gigabit. mainly servers and my workstation, with a small 8 port 100mb/s switch with a 1gb uplink connected to a 5 port or so gigabit switch. the 5 port gigabit switch would have connections for my servers, workstations and the 8port 100mb switch. the 100mb switch would connect to the router, other computers on the network, my mac, etc. just for testing you see. but interesting question none the less.
