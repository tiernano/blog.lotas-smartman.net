Well, as most (or at least i think most) of you know, I live in Dublin, Ireland. I have been looking for a good mapping suite for Sat Nav (as i have the very broken sense of direction and always get lost&#8230;). The only place i seem to have found with good Geo Data for Ireland (100% clamed on their site) is [Route 66][1]. I am looking at picking one of their new [Chicago all in one units][2] in November, and onces its live, i will actually bite the bullit and buy it. But there are some questions. 

Firstly, why does Ireland have such bad GPS&nbsp;coverage? Well, its not GPS coverage thats the problem, but mapping data is. The [Ordnance Survay][3] guys have maps of everywhere, and im sure its digital, so why the lack of good mapping data? 

Secondly: Mapping sites. [Windows Live Local][4], [Google Maps][5], [Yahoo Local Maps][6], etc, all cant get the data about Ireland. If i go to Windows Live Local, zoom in to my house, and say i want directions from here to the nearest coffee shop, i get directions to somewhere in Belfast, about 150 miles away! and here is me thinking the nearest coffee shop is only about a mile or 2 away&#8230; This is going to be a big issue for a lot of people. I think the main issue with it is geotagging addresses. In the UK, your postal code means a lot. people can work out how far away you are from them just by giving them a post code. In Dublin its pretty meaningless. Take where i live for example, Tallaght. Tallaght, and to an extent [City West][7], both have the same post code, D24. The problem with that is D24 covers somewhere in the region of maybe 40 &#8211; 50 thousand houses (Tallaght, the last time i checked, had roughly 120,000 people in it). the problem with that is its not exactly usefull. I have seen sat nav systems in the UK where you type in the postal code, and they can tell you a list of 1 or 2 streets you should be going to. Thats what i want!

3: Traffic info. Again, checking the Route 66 device, one of the extras is TMC (Traffic&nbsp;Mesaging Channel, or at least i think thats what it is). This is running is pretty much EVERY country in europe, EXCEPT Ireland. this i find stupid. There is a radio station that, at rush hour (which, in Dublin lasts from 6.30am to about 10am and from 4.30pm to 7pm and sometimes longer at both times&#8230;) &nbsp;only gives traffic news. so, my next question, why not make it digital and set up a TMC system? why is Dublin years behind everyone else on this? 

I know a lot of people are trying to get drivers out of their cars and into public transport (dont even get me started on that&#8230;) but this is not an option for a lot of people. If i get a bus to work, it takes me an hour and a half to get in, and then theres the 20 min walk to the building i work in (not complaing about the walking, but if its raining, its not fun). If i jump into my car and drive, im in work 15min later, and no walking in rain. Im not waiting for a bus, not hoping to get a seat, and its direct. 

To tell you the truth, after writing this, i dont know what the point is. Im just ranting on about the lack of usefull stuff here. I know i can go out and buy normal GPS gear, and get nav for Dublin, but what about the rest of the country? I seen one that had about 6 towns and Dublin listed, which &#8220;75% of major roads listed&#8221;. The problem is whats classed as a major road to them? Is an N road (National road, not quite a Dual Carage way in some cases, though they can be N roads too, but just below a motorway) a Major Road, or are they missing too? what about R Roads? (Regional roads, usually linking N and M (motorways) to each other, or going though towns etc). Right, enough of a rant for today. Sorry to &#8220;rant on&#8221; on your Sunday&nbsp;morning!
