[MySQL Takes on MSSQL][1].  


> A Swedish upstart is challenging Microsoft in the database arena by making use of the same low-end assault tactics that the software giant employed to gain a foothold.</p> 
> 
> MySQL, which sells an open-source database of the same name, was nearly unheard of in corporate technology circles a few years ago. Now the company&#8217;s competitively priced, easy-to-use database is becoming increasingly popular with business customers looking for smaller, less-expensive options. 

MySQL is quite cool. got it talking to my copy of VS.NET and im working on building an ASP.NET copy of my blog for testing and learning. its quite fast and cheap. i got mine for the princly sum of a 14mb download! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
