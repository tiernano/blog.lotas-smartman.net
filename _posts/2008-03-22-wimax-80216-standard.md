[Slashdot | WiMax Formed To Promote 802.16 Standard][1]. Hmmmm. 31miles of users with 70Mbits/s. That does sound like a lot of data, but 31miles is about the size of Dublin City, and that has a population of 1.2million + people. thats about 61bits/s with all users using it. now even at 10-1 ratio, thats 610bit/s. the GSM network, at 9.6k a sec beets that. now as this [reply][2] states, &#8220;*They claim that WiMax-powered hot spots could cheaply offer wireless broadband access to citywide areas, bringing Wi-Fi closer to cellular network levels of ubiquity. *&#8220;. That could be interesting. theres lots of stuff this could do. check it out.
