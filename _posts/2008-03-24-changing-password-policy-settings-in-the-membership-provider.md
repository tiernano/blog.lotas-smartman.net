Second post on the Membership provider tonight, and this one from [Paschal][1]. [How to change the password policy settings for the membership provider][2]. By default, your password must include minimum of 7 charicters, at least one uppercase, one number and 1 non alphanumeric charicter. This allows you to set it specifically for your self. handy!
