[Tom&#8217;s Hardware Guide Games & Entertainment: Suunto&#8217;s n3 Adds Web Access to Watch Wear &#8211; Introduction][1]. interesting reivew of spot technology. The I would love to get one of these. just to play with it. only thing is its not in Europe yet, and although i charge everything else at night (PDA, phone) i dont think the idea of charging your watch appeals to me, but i might be wrong. I have gone from 3 charges a week with my old Nokia 7650, to charging nearly every day with my smartphone, but it does a lot more.
