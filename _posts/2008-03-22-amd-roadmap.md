[The Register][1]. Hmmm. i like the AMD chips. i have all major workstations and servers running them (workstation = Athlon 1.33gz, server 1 = Duron 700mhz, server 2 = K6-2 450mhz). I hope AMD win the race again. this dual Barton Based XP would be pretty cool, especially with a 333Mhz FSB. the 400Mhz would be better. so we see what happens. i know the Xeon is some major competition with its Hyper threading, and the like will be hard to beat, but hopefully the 64bit optron will do a good job. Lets hope it runs linux VERY FAST!
