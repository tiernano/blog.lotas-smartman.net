[this place][1] is selling Amiga ones with G3 and G4 processors and shipping with either Amiga OS or Linux. Sweet. now my question is could i get it running OSX with [Mac on Linux][2]? See, that would be the biggest chalange for this. if it could, its on my wish list! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
