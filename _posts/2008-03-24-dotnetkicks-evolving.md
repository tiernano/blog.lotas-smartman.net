Over the last while, [DotNetKicks][1] has been getting better and better. This morning 2 new features where added: [Support to see who has Kicked an item][2], and me! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> I am now a Mod of DotNetKicks becuase there is some spam hitting the site. I am very honored to be a mod on the site, and I would like to thank Gavin for, not only offering me this task, but also for the great work he (and the other team members) have done on the job! Also, something that i should have posted a while back is that DotNetKicks is now open source, and the [code is available][3] on Google Code for anyone to read and review, and if they find bugs they can fix, or features they would like to impliment, add code to the project.

Very cool stuff!&nbsp;
