So, [in the previous article][1], I mentioned I talked about the PC part of the Media Center (I see the Media Center as more than just the PC, its the whole package). My Current setup has a Yamaha RX-V357 AV receiver and speakers (standard speakers that came with the amp). Now with the Advent of HDMI, and Multiple HDMI sources, I really need to upgrade to something with more bite (and an appetite for HDMI!).

So, not really knowing a lot about Amps and Receivers leaves me in a bit of a pickle. So, I went looking and found [this article over at ECustics.com][2] which tells you want to look for in a home cinema receiver. In the article, they talk about everything from inputs to ohms and Codecs. and in the section about Codecs, they drop a name: [Onkyo TX-SR606][3]. They mention that this will decode Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD (master audio) and it has 4 HDMI ports. Since 4 is the magic number (not 3 as they say) for me, this is the Amp for me. and, not only that, its cheap! So, how cheap? Well, [Komplett have it][4] currently for EUR500. and, for that price, with 4 HDMI connections and everything else, plus the fact I can get it in Black, I am very wanting this!

Next time, I will start looking at speakers. Leave a comment (they now work) if you have any questions or advice for either my Receiver or the Media Center. always looking for feedback!
