this tutorial over at Labo Apple.com<a /> shows you how to build your own OSX kernel. Might be handy for speed tweaks or what have you. i wont be trying it cause my mac is too slow. interesting read though. In other news which i will post here because i want to and im too lazy to create a new post, check out [this channel 9 video</a> about monad. Interesting. i watched this on the bus this morning. very nice watch. Actually i posted about it yesterday [here][1]. When recompressed the 73Mb Video is brought down to about 17mb. not bad, but quality could be better. that being said, what do you expect for an encoding at 50KBits/s?][2]</a>
