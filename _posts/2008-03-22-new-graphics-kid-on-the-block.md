[this review on toms hardware][1] has info on [XGIs][2] new dual chip graphics card. this thing looks cool, but benchmarks dont do it justice. the review says that the hardware and software are still being tested. the software is beta and the hardware is still being worked on. even still, its not bad for a first product. looks pretty cool. i think i have hit a limit on graphics card in my machine though. a lot seem to come with 8X AGP, but my board only supports 4X. and since there are 2 2Gz Athlons in there, i wont be upgrading any time soon. ahhh well, graphics on this are sweet as they are.
