Ok. i am having some problems with the dual processor system im running at the moment. the system is running TOO HOT! the chips are saying there running at between 75 &#8211; 100Deg C!!! FFS! Thats madness. the heat sinks and fans on them are rated to athlon 2800+ CPUs. There only 2400+. im off to [peats][1] tomorrow to get some fans to get cold air from outside the case and some of sending it out the back too. This is not fair!!! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> I get the system running (fairly) grand and this now happens! lets hope it get it running for tomorrow night.
