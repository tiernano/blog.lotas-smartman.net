[mcdonalds pic Wayport for Wifi Rollout][1] nationwide. This is US only at the moment, but it would be nice to see this comming world wide. that would bring wifi to the masses! like, a road trip in Ireland would mean food and email break nearly every 2 hours. only thing is, if the price is right, like in the US (above article says $2.95 for 2 hours) it could takes a lot longer to get to where your going if you stop every 2 hours for 2 hours&#8230;. Still, would be fun.
