not 100% sure whats going on here, but my system is causing some problems and rebooting in the middle of me reading stuff online. basicly, i can see that in the system event log there is a \&#8221;Save dump\&#8221; entry saying the system rebooted after saving a dump in such a place. this is the 3rd time in 2 days. so, needless to say, i hope its a software problem. reinstall windows tomorrow, and hope everything works properly!
