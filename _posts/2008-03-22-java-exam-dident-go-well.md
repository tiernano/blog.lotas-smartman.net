Right. i had my Java 1.2 Exam today, but i failed. i got 40% and needed at least 61% to pass. i know its my own fault. dident study as much as i should/could have. i am disappointed but i know i can do it again later on in the year (at a cost to me this time) when i have more time to study. Still have to make some nice java apps to upload to the site. maybe in the next few days&#8230;.
