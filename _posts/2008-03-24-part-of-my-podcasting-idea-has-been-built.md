A while back i had the idea of using Amazon S3 and EC2 to[build a large podcasting and Video casting network][1]. Well, part of this has been built (not by me, mind you) and proves its posible! Its called [Mux][2] and it transcodes video into different formats. definatly a step closer to the idea of recording a video cast, uploading to the web in one format, and EC2 generating different versions of it for distribution. [[Via AWS Blog][3]]</p>
