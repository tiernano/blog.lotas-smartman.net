Im getting the router form a place called [Kompeltt][1]. They use [DHL][2] to send the package. Its costing me about .12 for overnight delevery from Norway! I think [amazon][3] are charging about that for 2 &#8211; 3 week shipping and nearly 2x that for express, but i dont know what they call express. I was going to buy a [Linksys][4] router from them, but komplett have a cheaper, and quicker one. Anyway, the thing i really find cool about DHL is [this page][5]. Track your delevery. and the text number rocks too! i send them a text and get a message telling me about the package! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> yeah!
