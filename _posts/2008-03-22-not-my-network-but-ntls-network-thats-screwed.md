Wahoo! its not me! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> my network is not broke, but its NTL\&#8217;s. not sure how they broke it, but its an NTL problem. a friend of mine told me he couldent get into Hotmail, which i cant either. must have some HTTP Posts envolved in loggin in. notting on the NTL website, but hopefully this will be fixed soon.
