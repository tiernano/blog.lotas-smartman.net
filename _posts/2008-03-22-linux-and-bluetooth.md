Hmmmm. havent posted about linux in a while so here is a few links about Linux and Bluetooth.

  * [Linux Nokia 7650 Howto][1]
  * [Bluetooth and linux][2] Info and more
  * [Bluetooth Install on Linux][3]

Im going to try to move to linux soon. i want linux on my workstation and now that i got the new board that supports it, why the hell not!!! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> i have a copy of [VMware][4] so i can run windows apps when needed. i should have my chips by the time im learning VB in Fas so that should allow me to run VB under VMware a lot faster. dont be suprised if the next post is from my linux box <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
