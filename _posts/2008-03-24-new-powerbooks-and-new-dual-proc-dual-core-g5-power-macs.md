Ok, this i like! Apple have come out with the new [PowerMac G5 Quad][1]&nbsp;which&nbsp;is a&nbsp;dual proc, dual core system, with upto 16Gb ram, 1Tb hdd, and can hold upto 4 PCI Express Graphics cards. Not only that, but each card can power the [30&#8243; Cinema Display][2]! Thats a lot of screen real estate! And also, the new [PowerBooks][3] are out too. they have better resolution, and i dont know what else just yet.
