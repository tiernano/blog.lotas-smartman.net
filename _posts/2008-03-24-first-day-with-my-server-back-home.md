So, the server has been home for roughly a day now, and its working grand. i cant seem to get it to go though my ISA 2004 Box for some reason, but i will try figure that one out later. the reason i want it to go though the ISA box is so i can have a lot more servers other then just one running though 1 ip address. i will explain that more later! Still reading stuff about getting a second cable modem into the house for twice the bandwidth goodness, but still a lot of reading to do to get it to work, when ever i eventually get it.
