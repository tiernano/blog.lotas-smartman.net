Men&#8217;s Health.com has an [article showing you how to grill the best steak ever][1]. There is info on how to do the sauce for the steak, and then out to work out if how well its cooked! They also have some interesting Recipies:

[BBQ Beer Ribs][2]&nbsp;(Beer and Meat?! is there anything better?)

[BBQ Steak Wrap][2] (Bring your steak with you!)

[Beer-B-Q Chicken][2] (Hmmm, BEER!)

All this BBQ talk has gotten me in the mood for Beer, BBQ and Cigars&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
