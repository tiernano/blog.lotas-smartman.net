Google are to double their storage from 1Gb to 2Gb! [More about that at Ars Technica][1]. pretty mad. it was about this time last year when i head about Gmail first, and everyone though it was an April fools joke. im half asleep, but i hope this is true. [update] my account has been updated to 1272mb, which is strange, and also, theres rich test editing of your email. check the comments below from Pascal.
