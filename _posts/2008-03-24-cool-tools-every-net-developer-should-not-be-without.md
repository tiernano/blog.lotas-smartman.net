[Roy Osherove has a list of cool tools for .NET developers][1]. i have to try these at home. one more thing a good .NET developer needs is a lot of good music. and a keyboard with media controls to move from one song to an other. i have some very questionable songs on my laptop that i listen to, and some songs that are great, but finding the right one is important, and if something you dont want to listen to comes up, a quick exit from that is handy. but check out the tools.
