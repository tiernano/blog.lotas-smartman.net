[this slashdot article][1] talks about how microsoft (well Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Ralph Lauren teamed up with Bruce Canepa) modified the porsche 959 to be streat legal in the US. they made a 15 year old car do 215Mph, 0-60 in 3.3Seconds and have 575 BPH! my 6 year old car cant do that! Man. just shows what german engeering at its best and a lot of money can do!
