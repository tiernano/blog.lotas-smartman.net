[XP SP2 Launch Price: $300 Million][1]. Hmmmm. i have been running this at home for the last few weeks now and everything is going grand. actually, my machine has been up for the last 19 days now, so its very stable. one thing. if your used to having 1Gb of ram, dont down grade to 512mb! when i took my second 512mb dimm out and put it in the server, my workstation slowed right down. not initially, but when its been locked for a few hours, and you unlock it, it takes about a min to wake back up. it used to be instant! looking to get ram for the server soon, so my workstation should be back to normal. but, back to SP2, its very stable and im only running the RC too! bk_keywords: windows xp
