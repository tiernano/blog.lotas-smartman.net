[this register article][1] talks about an Finish company, Teleste, who are working with a dutch cable operator Essent Kabelcom, to develop fast internet access called ethernet to the home. they offer speeds of 10mb/s to residantial and 50mb symmetrical to business! The cool part about this is its done over old coax cables! Cool. theres a lot of these running around Tallght. i wonder if ntl will start running this around the place. 50mb connection would be quite sweet! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
