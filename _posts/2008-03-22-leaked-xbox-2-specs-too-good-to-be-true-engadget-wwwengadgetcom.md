[Leaked Xbox 2 specs too good to be true &#8211; Engadget &#8211; www.engadget.com][1]. Wonder if there will be a newer leak soon with more info. I posed [here back in Febuary][2] that it would have the equivilant of 12 processors. there would be three 2 core cpus running with hyperthreading. i dont know. its a while back since that article was posted. actually, the update on [this page][3] says dont beleve everything you read. i think ill give up on posting news about XBox2.
