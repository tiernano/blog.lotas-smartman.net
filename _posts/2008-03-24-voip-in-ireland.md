I have been looking into VOIP for a while. One thing that has stoped us for a while is the Dublin Phone number. We have a number, that friends and family know, and just have to pick up a Mobile or land line phone (no computer stuff) and call. Well, i have found 3 providers who now offer Irish land line numbers! [BlueFace][1] (which i&nbsp;think i will be moving to), [FreeSpeach.ie][2] and Smart Telecom&#8217;s [Smart 076][3] (076 is the VOIP dialing code for Ireland). So, now just to set the whole thing up and see how it works! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
