A few differences:

1: the Amazon demo uses the S3 URLs in their pages, mine has a redirect in the ASHX file.

2: They generate Thumbnails for the images, which is a nice touch, but most of the time is not required for the images I upload, so i probably wont implement that anytime soon.

3: they are using an Access DB for storage, i have a full SQL box.

4: their code is available now! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> eventually mine will be, but that might take a while&#8230;
