There&#8217;s been a huge media buzz surrounding Virginia Tech&#8217;s Power Mac G5-based parallel-computing &#8220;supercluster.&#8221; Comprising 1,100 dual-processor G5 systems, Virginia Tech&#8217;s system is clocked as the third-fastest supercomputing system in the world, at a price that&#8217;s only a fraction of what other supercomputing systems in its class cost. Now Apple has [posted a profile][1] on its Web site of the new system, dubbed &#8220;System X.&#8221; [[MacCentral][2]] i would like just one of these systems never mind the 1100!
