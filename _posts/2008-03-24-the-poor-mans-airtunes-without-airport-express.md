Right, so you bought you self the big amp and audio gear, and set it up in the house. but how do you get the music, which is on your machine up stairs, or many machines upstairs for that matter, playing on your stereo. [Infected Project may have the answer][1]. it uses some software called [SlimServer][2] which streams your music over the network. i have to play more around with this before i can give a definite answer on if its really cool, or just ok cool&#8230;

now, where the hell do I get a small machine that will play audio over VCL to plug into my amp&#8230;. </p>
