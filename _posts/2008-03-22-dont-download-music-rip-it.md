[Slashdot are talking about how users are ripping music from streaming sites][1] insted of downloading it. when you rip it, no one can track you! it looks like a normal listener listening to music. but insted theres software downloading the stream. theres a peice of software called [Station ripper][2], which is free, and does this for you. SWEET. and it cant be tracked!! haha. stuff that in your pipe mr RIAA, and smoke it! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
