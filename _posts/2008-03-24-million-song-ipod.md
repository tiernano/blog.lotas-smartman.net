Very interesting article over [here on Duke Listens][1] about the idea of a million song iPod. Well, he ends up saying that because at the moment the only way to do the subscription music service, which is what he is talking about and you should have a read, would make it not an ipod because its Microsoft DRM. Interesting read none the less. wonder will anyone in Europe do a subscription service like this. i would like that a lot!
