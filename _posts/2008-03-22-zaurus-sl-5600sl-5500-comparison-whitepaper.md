[Slashdot | Zaurus SL-5600/SL-5500 Comparison Whitepaper][1] Sounds nice. i want a different palm top then the one i have. main reason is the fact i cant get a blue tooth adapter for it cheap (costs .220+, more then the palm top cost me!) and i cant get a WLAN card for it at all (only available on bigger sony Clie&#8217;s). I have a Sonly Clie PEG SL10. if i had the money, something like this would be good. either that or a windows CE or Pcoket PC2002 device, but linux would be nice! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
