Gizmodo are reporting that the [next Robbie Williams album will be released by the CarPhoneWarehouse on MMC card][1]. It will include stuff like video and wallpapers too. Sounds interesting, but what format will the music be? I know Apple and Motorola have a deal for Apples iTunes Music to play on&nbsp;some Motorola phones, but what format are we going to see here? Why am i asking? Well, iTunes songs wont play on my smartphone, and DRMed WMA files wont play on non microsoft smartphone, and come to think of it, they might not play on my phone either. and i dont see any record industry being happy with the idea of non DRMed music going on to mobile phones with the speeds on networks nowadays. We will see. Cool idea though.
