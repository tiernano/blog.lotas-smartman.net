So, [Engadget has some photos of the new Motorola iTunes phone][1] and i dont know what the big deal is. It plays music from the iTunes store and syncs with iTunes. **Big Deal!** My phone has been playing music from the [MyCokeMusic][2] and [Eircom][3] music stores, and syncing with <a rhef="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/mp10/default.aspx">Windows Media Player 10</a> for the [9 months][4]. Ok, i know the link is for my Pocket PC, but my SmartPhone plays WMAs that are DRMed. and so does my XDA. Mind you, 128mb SD card doesent hold a lot of songs (currently about 3 hours or so, 46 songs and 1 full album). So i have just orderd myself a 512mb SD Card, which should be here in a few days and allow me to have a LOT more music. Anyway, i think the whole iTunes phone is a bit of a &#8220;Big Deal&#8221;. Ahh well, i wonder when everyone will realize how much of a big deal it actually is. Except those mac guys who know &#8220;apple can do no wrong&#8221;. [edit] By the Way, my phone is an iMate SmartPhone 2 and an XDA 2s. Just for you who dont know.
