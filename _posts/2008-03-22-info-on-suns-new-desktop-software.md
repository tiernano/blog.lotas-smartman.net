[this osnews article][1] and [this newsforge article][2] has info on the new sun software code named mad hatter. this, if it works well, should be pretty cool. i wonder. will someone take linux and build a top GUI for it like the [Mac OS X][3]? apple took FreeBSD and build Aqua on top and look how that turned out! now the other question is would the linux community welcome this? i dont really see why they wouldent though.
