Ok. as you may, or may not, have noticed, the title of of the site is currently screwed. its my fault. yesterday i modified my template yesterday in Frontpage and it must of modified the title slightly and though the PHP was what i wanted to show to people. i dont have write access remotly for this, so i cant modify it now, but i will fix this when i get home!
