I used to run a distributed client called [Dnetc][1] before i decided to play with seti. so i havent played with this in a while, i cant even remember what my speed was before the 2 cpus, but it has support for dual processors, mainly by telling to run multible crucnhers. its a client for hacking a RC-72 encrypted key. im just testing it and im reaching 12Million keys a Second!!! thats 1Trillian keys a day. wahoo! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> since there is a total of 4722366482869645213696 keys to be checked, it would take my machine 4722366482.869645213696 days alone to complete! Hmmm. dont think im doing this on my own! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
