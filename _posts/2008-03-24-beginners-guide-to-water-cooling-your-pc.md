Toms Hardware has a <a class href="http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/03/28/a-beginners-guide-for-watercooling-your-pc/">Beginners guide for water cooling your PC</a>. the question, some of you are probably thinking, is Why?! Simple. Quiter computing. My Main MCE has 2 large fans cooling the processors, one cooling the MoBo, and then there are a couple others running. So Water cooling should make things quiter, and cooler too.
