Hmmmm. the register has [this article][1] about how google is to make a new tab just for weblogs. this could meen the end of results for weblogs in googles main section of the site. i know i will loose traffic if this happens, and i wont be too happy, but it will also meen if im looking for something specific on a weblogs, i can go to, probably, blogs.google.com! anyway, it will also how exactly how many blogs are there cause google will tell you the total blogs indexed. it wont be good news for [Feedster][2], the newest of the blog search engines if google come in. it could reduice their traffic to the site. Hmmmm is all im going to finish with. hmmmmmm.
