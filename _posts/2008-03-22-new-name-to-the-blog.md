Ok. I realised that for the last year and a bit, my site has been known as LSN Blog.Thats all well and good, but if you google for me, [Tiernan O&#8217;Toole][1], emmmm, well that back fired. you find me. Ahhh! thats it! if you google for for just [tiernan][2], you dont find me. Actually, im not even in the top 10! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> so, hopefully this will solve all problems! It just looks cooler if someone is looking for me and they find me by my first name. watch this space! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
