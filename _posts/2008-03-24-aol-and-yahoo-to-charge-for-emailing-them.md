Slashdot has an article which just sounds stupid: AOL and (eventually) Yahoo will start [charging to get email to their subscribers][1]. Not sure if this is everyone, or just mailing lists, but its weird. In one way it could be handy, in killing spammers, but in another way, it could block legit emails from places who dont want to pay AOL and Yahoo money to send email.
