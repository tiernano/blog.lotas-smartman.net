Im now running [Gentoo Linux][1]! it is pretty sweet. using opera now as my browser till mozilla compiles. building gnome, kde, open office, mozilla, and evolution. should take a few hours. Also, getting that mac on saturday. check out the [photo blog][2], which is now at the side too, to see photos!
