[cnet is reporting][1] that apple has hit the 25million download mark. only problem is [it could be costing them more then they are making][2]! they also sold 1.4 million ipods since october. the ipod is on the top of [my wish list][3] (may as well put it in for the laff!!), but probably wont be getting one till after christmas.
