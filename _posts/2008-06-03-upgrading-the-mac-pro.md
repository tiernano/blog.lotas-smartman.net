So, I have been thinking of upgrading my workstation at home for a while now, and I have found one possible solution. See, the MacPro came originally with 2 Dual core Xeons at 2.66Gz. if I wanted to move to 2 Quad Core Xeons (which I do), I would need to buy me a couple of Xeon 5355.&nbsp; These ain&rsquo;t cheap! [Elara][1] are selling them for a [683EUR][2], each!  
&nbsp;  
So, while playing around, I found [this post][3], talking about overlclocking the [E5320&nbsp;Xeon][4] to 1333Mhz FSB, and&nbsp;how well it works&nbsp;with the mac pro. Given&nbsp;that the E5320&#8217;s&nbsp;sell for 245EUR, i&nbsp;can get 2&nbsp;of them for less than the price of 1 of the 5355s. And, since memory is cheap, a couple extra gigs of ram will be thrown in for good mesure&#8230; 4Gb Kit (2x2Gb FBDIMMS) cost [136EUR][5] on Shop4Memory at the moment&#8230;&nbsp; which makes the total upgrade (2 5320s and 2 4Gb kits) EUR762&#8230; only 79EUR more than a single Xeon 5355!
