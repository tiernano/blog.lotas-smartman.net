This is getting rediculas. someone has some sort of app that goes around and adds comments to blogs easly. this is a pain cause people are searching google for stuff, and comming to my site and posting these comments. i dont mind comments. i actually like comments. but people trying to sell &#8220;Enhancments&#8221; and cameras and stuff! FFS! is there a tool to get users to type in a number or series of letters from an image that a comptuer cant read? like what they have in most places that have users signing up for stuff?
