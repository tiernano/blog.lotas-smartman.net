<a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/36178.html\">George Micheal is to give his music away for free on the internet</a>&nbsp;the register is reporting. Interesting. he says he wont make an other album, doesent like the fame and doesent need the cash! His website is at <a href=\"http://www.georgemichael.com/\">www.georgemichael.com/</a> and im checking it now to see if the music is live today. Looks like it could be live today! the server is taking one hell of a beating! its bearly responding! haha! anyway, im not exactly a fan, but some of his music is good. Free music is always good! [update] fixed the url to his site!
