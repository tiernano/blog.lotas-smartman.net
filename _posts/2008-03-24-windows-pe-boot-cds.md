Very interesting [article][1] over at mszCool&#8217;s thoughs and cents revealed about boot CDs, Windows PE (Preinstallation Environment) and Windows AIK (Automated Installation toolKit). The really interesting part of this is how easy it seems to be. I might try this for something&#8230;. dont know what yet though&#8230;
