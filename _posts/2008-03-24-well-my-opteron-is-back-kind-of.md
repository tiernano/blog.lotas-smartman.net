And then [I read a post][1] by [Richard Campbell where a machine of his died][2], similarly, and he realized his was caused by a dead power supply. Then, I started to think. Maybe my Opteron had died the same death. Well, after some checking of different power supplies, and then realizing that I hadn&#8217;t got one with all the connections (it requires an ATX 20+4 connector, and 2 CPU connectors, each 4pin), I left it for a while. I was told one of these power supplies was going to cost me, and cost me big. cheapest I got a quote for was 190EURO and that was a 850W power supply. considering the one it was replacing was only 300W, I decided against it. 

This morning I rang a place, and they suggested, and this is the engineers own words, &#8220;A [MacGyver][3] hack&#8221; (hence the image). all cables on the power supply are color coded. taking the connector I needed off the old power supply and splicing it to the new one, he suggested, would work.

Well, he was right! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> My Opteron now posts, and it works. I tool the 8 pin CPU connector, which was off the old power supply, and then took some cables from the new power supply (there was a 6 pin, which I think is for PCI Express graphics cards, but could be wrong)&nbsp;and one of the 4 pin CPU connectors, and chopped their heads off. then, using one of those connector blocks (I&#8217;m not great at soldering, and couldn&#8217;t find the soldering iron anyway) and connected everything up. after one false start (tripped the breaker for my bedroom) and a bit more tweaking, I got it completely&nbsp;working!

Now to work out some issues around cooling&#8230; just to explain that, the old power supply sat behind 2 large heat syncs, each connected to the CPUs via Heat Pipes (photos eventually). the power supply had 2 small (but quite noisy) fans, which cooled the 2 heat syncs. now without that power supply, these are air cooled, but currently without any fan. Now to look into fixing that.
