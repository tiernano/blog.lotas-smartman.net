I&#8217;m watching the [Motorola Media Event][1] and the first thing they talked about was the fact that the iTunes phone would be released before the end of this quarter, before their competitors. Well, there slightly wrong. How are their competitors? Nokia and Microsoft. Nokia has a music phone for the last while now ([Osnews show you the nokia 3300 which has been out for years][2]) and there comming out with more, and i have had my phone playing mp3s for [ages now too][3]. so what competitors have they beaten? how do they work out that they are better? Argh!
