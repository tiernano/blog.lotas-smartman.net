found this post over at rakimk’s blog showing you [how to sync your Windows Live Writer drafts between machines with Live Mesh][1]. I have stepped it up one further and shared my whole Windows Live Writer directory (drafts AND previous posts) with [Live Mesh][2]. Not sure why, but I did…

Also, using a similar technique, I have synced my IE favorites folder. not sure why I haven&#8217;t thought of that before… mind you, ideally, some sort of cloud service to sync both IE and Firefox bookmarks together would be a lot nicer…
