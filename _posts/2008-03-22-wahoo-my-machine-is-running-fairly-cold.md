Well colder then it was. it was hitting 75DegC and maxing out about 80, now its running about 51Deg under half load. well one of them is running 55Deg. In the last 30min, one chip has hit a max temp of 57.5 and the other has hit 54.5. Thats at half load. one chip is running @ about 100% load, the other very little. Pretty cool. going to start [Seti][1] again!
