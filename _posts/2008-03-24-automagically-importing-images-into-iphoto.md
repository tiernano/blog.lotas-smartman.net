[this article over at Oreilly&#8217;s Digital media magazine][1] shows you how to get your images automagically imported into iPhoto, but with a difference. i used iPhoto for a while, but the thing i hated was downloading the images from my phone at the time (Nokia 7650) onto the mac and then importing them into iPhoto. this article shows you how to do that automaticlly. so, you have all your photos on your phone, you select them and you send them to the mac. the mac automatically accepts the incomming request, because the phone is a favourite and its secured, etc, and puts the files into a directory. then you can tell OSX to run a script that that adds the photos into iPhoto every time a new photo is added to that directory. pretty sweet idea. i want it for windows! now to find my bluetooth dongel for my mac&#8230;
