Its only postponed for a few days, but i have had to postpone the [move of my workstation to Windows Server 2008][1], and the rest of my checks on the OS, till probably next week. the reason is because this blog is now hosted on the Mac Pro, which is the workstation i am upgrading.

As you may have noticed, the move to Graffiti has had some Theeding problems. Firslty, the whole post is not being displayed on the front page. Hopefully this is a simple fix&#8230; But, good news! Comments are now working again! Or at least they should be! Leave a comment and i can confirm they work! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
