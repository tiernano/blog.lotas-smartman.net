Apple has just opened iTunes Music Stores for [UK][1], [Germany][2] and [France][3]. No word on an Irish one yet, but the UK site is UK and Ireland, so i hope to be able to access it. Going to try it out now and see what its like. [Update] Nope! Ireland is not allowed in! Damn! and i wouldent mind but Apple have a plant here (well, in Cork). It better arive soon!
