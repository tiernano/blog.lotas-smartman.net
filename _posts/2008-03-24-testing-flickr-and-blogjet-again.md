Just testing [Flickr][1] and [BlogJet][2] again because for some reason Community Text does not like images with the alt attribute of image&nbsp;first and the src attribute after. It just does not display anything. i wonder is there a way of modifying the template that is used to post photos?

[**update**] Even after modifying the code before posting, it gets posted wrong anyway! Argh!
