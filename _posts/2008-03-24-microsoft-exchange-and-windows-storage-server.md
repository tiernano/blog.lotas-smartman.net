Check out this article over at MSExchange.org explaining [how to use Windows Storage Server and Exchange togther][1] for storing your Exchange DB and your Transaction Logs. Interesting&#8230; I like the sound of this [Windows Storage Server][2] too. Might solve my need of a large NAS server on the network! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
