[slashdot reports][1] that [Redhat][2] and [SuSE][3] are to offer educational discounts on their software. Redhat will be creating a new line of software both based on [Redhat Enterprise Linux][4], one for the desktop for students based around Redhat Enterprise Linux Workstation that will sell for $25 and the server edition for schools, etc, based of Redhat Enterprise Linux Server. Suse, on the other hand, will be offering discounts of up to 40% to students and educational bodies. now my question: can a student buy a server edition of Redhat, or is it only schools, etc? i would buy 2 or 3 copies of the workstation and a copy of the server for use on the network.
