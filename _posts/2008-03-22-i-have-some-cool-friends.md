it was my 21st on tuesday and the major party was saturday (which im still drunk from) and firday (over the pub, which im semi hung over from). so the party. lots of drink consumed (pictures of empty cans, full ones and the left overs) and also lots of madness going on. and 3 frieds of mine (Chirs, Cormac and Mick, going alphibetically so not to make someone geal left out or what ever) bought me a DVD+ and &#8211; R/RW drive! how cool is that! i got some pretty mad presents and the best one was all my mates being around and getting quite drunk and having a laff. i am drunk so i dont really care, but i am happy!
