Analysts are split over the plausibility of rumors that Apple Computer will announce a $100 iPod. Some, meanwhile, muse that an Apple media center could be coming soon to beat Microsoft to the punch. [[CNET News.com (20 stories)][1]] its an interesting article there. its going to be good for me and for a lot of college students and users who dont want to spend, or cant spend, that kind of money on a music player. if apple do release a $100 ipod, it could be the next big thing. i dont think its going to cause headaches for apple themselves. i think there will still be a market for the 10-40gb ipods since they have a hard drive, lots more space, and quite frankly, they rock!
