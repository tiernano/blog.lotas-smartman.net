> Miguel demonstrates how to [run a simple Java application using the Gtk# libraries and the .Net runtime.][1] Complete apps like Eclipse can be run too, impressive! You can either pre-compile Java bytecode to .Net IL, or have this done on the fly by a JITter. You need to export (netexp.exe) the .Net assemblies you want to use from the Java code. I curious how IKVM exports some .Net types like events and delegates, but haven&#8217;t looked much at it yet. Update: The IKVM weblog just posted an answer to these. Also, I wonder if debugging works well through the whole&#8230;
