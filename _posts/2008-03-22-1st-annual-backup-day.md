[Friday October 3rd][1] is the first annual backup day! Cool. i back up every few weeks &#8211; months because i need to reinstall. i should do it more often, but once a year is not enough! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
