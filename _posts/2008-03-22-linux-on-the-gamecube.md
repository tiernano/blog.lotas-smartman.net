Slashdot are [running this article][1] about linux running on a game cube. unfortunitly the main [linux-gc][2] site is currently down, probably due to the slashdot effect, but it does sould cool. AFAIK, the gamecube has an IBM Power PC Chip running @ over 400Mhz. to run this on your Game Cube, you need some stuff, like a broad band adapter, a memory card, and a few other things. anyway, looks like it could be fun. wonder about speed. **[update]** the chip IS an IBM PowerPC&nbsp;running @ 486Mhz, it has ATI Graphics, 40Mb of Total RAM and (optional) 10/100 net. the site is up, but must be taking a good slashdotting. interesting none the less.
