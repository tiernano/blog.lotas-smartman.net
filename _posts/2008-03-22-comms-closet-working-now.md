Ok. i just built my comms closet and it now works! all data on the network now flows though this closet. I have taken a lot of photos and im working on uploading them to a site in a few minutes. I just uploaded the photos, but they wont be available for a while yet. will update this post with photos when they are available. Its pretty cool so far though!!! [update] Photos are now Live, and are <a href=\"http://photos.lotas-smartman.net/c138662.html\">here</a>. Also, new photo place! <a href=\"http://photos.lotas-smartman.net/\">my photo site</a> is there. lots of mad photos, and soon to be more!
