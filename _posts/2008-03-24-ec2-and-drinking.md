The idea is simple: Send virtual drinks to people online that&nbsp;you either know, or what to know&nbsp;(kind of like in a bar) and when they receive it, they have 3 options: 

  * print out the page, and use it as an IOU
  * Schedule a meeting for the drinking (probably after lengthy online talking, as you never know who the other person might be&#8230;)
  * or just ignore it.

Anyway, that&#8217;s not the cool part. its the quote at the end:

> &#8220;Thank goodness for EC2. Otherwise this would be making me very very nervous because we have no hardware, rackspace, or bandwidth that can handle where I think we&#8217;re going.&#8221;

So, this EC2 is really a game breaker. now you don&#8217;t need a tone of hardware, bandwidth, resources, etc to build&nbsp;a massive site. Just some knowledge, a credit card with money on it and some programming skills and your sorted, ish.

Depending on money, resources and time, i may (big maybe) build a project on EC2 with S3 and see how things get on. test it internally with a lot of VMs, then move to EC2 for a while and see how things go&#8230; could be cool! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
