The problem I had was Newsgator, for me, was slow. it was down sometimes, had issues, and was, well, slow. So, 3 weeks ago I moved all my feeds to [Google Reader][1], and I have never looked back!&nbsp; yes, its Google, but because of that, I had to try it out. And, I&#8217;m impressed! I will probably talk a bit more about it later, but for now, here are some interesting stats:

If you are wondering where this Shared feed is, You can [check it out here][7]. I do share a lot of weird things, but some are interesting! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
