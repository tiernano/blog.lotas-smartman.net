[Neowin are reporting that][1] [think secret reckon a flash based ipod will be released at MacWorld][2]. They say it will be 1gb model, and maybe a 2gb model too. it will be $149 for the 1gb and $199 for the 2Gb. Looks interesting and it might be good. We will see. i dont know if i would get one though. for 199, i can get 2 1Gb memory SD cards for my PDA and have both Video and audio, and anything else i can get on there, and WMAs too!
