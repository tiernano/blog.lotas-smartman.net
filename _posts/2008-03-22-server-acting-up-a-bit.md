Right. not sure if any one has noticed, but the server is acting up a good bit over the last few days and has been rebooted 4 times since yesterday. not sure if i fixed it, but i think i &#8220;may have&#8221;. its a big &#8220;may have&#8221;, so i hope it does work! so, hopefully it will work. it crashed yesterday because it ran out of memory, but it has 128, and that &#8220;should&#8221; be enough. the server when it was at home had 256, but ran samba and squid, which took up a lot of memory. ill see what happens. Arse! just realised its using swap memory. it has 255mb, and its using 10. its got 86m free so ill keep my eye on it. cant log in from work to it via SSH, but have [webmin][1], which is OK, but not the best for admining it.
