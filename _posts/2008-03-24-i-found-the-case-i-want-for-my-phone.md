I have just found a case for my Phone that i definatly want! Check out [InnoPockets  
Magnesium case for the O2 XDA2s][1]. it costs just under $40, is black, which  
goes nice with my XDA, fully supports the keyboard (which is nicer then the case  
i got with the PDA, which makes me take the phone out to do anything with it,  
and just looks cool. it looks the part and i like the fact that the front opens  
up and folds down the back to use it as a rest for the device. now all i have to  
do is get some money into my credit card and order this thing! 

BTW, thanks Josh and Brian from [TinyScreenFuls.com][2]. i was listening to  
the [tinypodcast][3] about you talking about  
this and decided to see if they had a case for my XDA. and they do! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
