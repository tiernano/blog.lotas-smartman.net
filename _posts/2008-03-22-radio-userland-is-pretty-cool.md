[Radio Userland][1] is pretty cool, and [Movable type][2] has its advantages, so im thinking of using both. i have been using both now for about the last 6 posts and this one now too. The part of radio i like the most is the built in news aggriator. You have a button which you click on and it posts the entire article to your site, or you can cut it down if you want. VERY NICE!
