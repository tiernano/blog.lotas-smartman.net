Ok. the board arived today. i have some pics here, and then im going to get the board up and running. it came with all the optional extras, like the USB2 card, Intel Pro 82551QM Network adapter onboard and a D-Bracket, which is a USB Dealy with 2 USB Ports and 4 LEDs so you have info about the system on the 4 LEDs or something. The images are [here][1] and i have also setup a [Lycos UK][2] mirror for my images [here][3] Pleate check out the Lycos mirror first as it has more bandwidth and less strain on my server here. thanks.
