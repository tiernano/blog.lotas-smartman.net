Apple have announced the new 17&#8243; version of their [MacBook Pro][1]. this is being written live as i read live from [Engadget][2] and [TUAW][3].

It has a Unibody enclosure, much like the 15&#8243; MBP and 13&#8243; MB which where announced last year.

it is just 0.98&#8243; think, weighs 6.6lbs and has a 1920X1200 display. anti glare option on the screen for $50. same battery display on the side and glass trackpad as the current MBP (15&#8243;).

upto 8Gb of memory (SWEET!) and NVidia chips for graphics.

Same dual GPU as 15&#8243;, 320gb hdd, up to 256gb SSD (option).

New battery &#8220;longest lasting battery, ever&#8221;. 8 hours! Christ! Thats a lot! 1000 recharges&#8230;

and tis environmentally friendly&#8230; (meh)

sounds like the battery is non removable&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />

whole machine uses less than 1/2 engery of single lightbulb (is that a 100w light bulb? i could say my Macpro uses the same as a single lightbulb too&#8230; if it where a 1kw lightbulb&#8230;)

if using the 9600GT graphics, you get 7 hours. use the 9400M graphics, get 8 hours&#8230;

program available to exchange the battery&#8230;

one config: $2799, 2.66Gz, 4Gb ram, 320Gb hdd. ships end of month.

the GPU has 512mb RAM, like the top end 15&#8243;.

Well, thats pretty much all on the MBP 17&#8243;&#8230; i will probably update with the other updates (iLife 09 and iWork 09 already announced&#8230; something about iTunes being done now&#8230; 3 pricing scales&#8230; eek&#8230;). more on that later&#8230;
