Ok. For some reason wordpress keeps chaning the URL of my blog to other things. now, the server i have the blog on has a lot of different names forwarding to it, but wordpress doesent know this and i dont know what the hell its playing at! I will be working on creating my new site running ASP.NET with my own custom wordpress clone. Dont get me wrong, wordpress is good, but it can be annoying. anyway, work might start tonight if i have a change. i have a [developers meeting tonight][1]. It might be tomorrow before i have it working though. was hacking it a bit last night, but dident get a lot working, and ISA is not playing nice either&#8230; which is more then likly my fault! anyway, more on that tomorrow!
