Check out this code snipet showing you [how to use C# to resize your images automaticly][1]. I wrote an app a while back that did something simular to this. a phototograper friend of mine needed a quick and easy way of resizing a load (and i mean a LOAD! i think it was somewhere in the region of 300 photos) of photos for printing. i think i managed to write it, and set up multithreading too, in about the same time it took him to resize about 10 in photo shop. unfortunitly, i lost the code. I think i will try that again soon. i may need it eventually. I wonder does the .NET imaging code support RAW images&#8230;.
