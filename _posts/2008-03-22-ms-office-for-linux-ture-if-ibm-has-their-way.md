Infoworld are [reporting that IBM want MS office on Linux][1]. And Microsoft aint complaining! They said they are not involved, and IBM may use Emulation. The thing that strikes me is that [CodeWeavers][2] has this already working with [CrossOver Office][3]. Maybe IBM could License the software off them?
