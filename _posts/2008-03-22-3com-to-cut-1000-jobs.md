[The Register][1]* 3Com is to outsource manufacturing operations, a move which will see 1,000 staff lose their jobs</p> 

Approximately 640 people will be made redundant with the closure of 3Com&#8217;s Dublin, Ireland manufacturing facility, by the end of February 2004. </i> heard this on the news a few days ago, but nothing definate. now it is. thats even less jobs available now!
