[this link][1] has info about a test that was run. 300 microsoft office files where downloaded off the net. then they where tested in StarOffice, OpenOffice, Gnome and KOffice all running under Redhat 8.0. The tests show that star office is the winner. cool. Check it out. note: the copy of [openoffice][2] was 1.0.1. a lot of new stuff has been added in since then and 1.1 beta is testing now. its a nice app. windows version available too!
