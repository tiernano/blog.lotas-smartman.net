[XDA II Announced [NeoWin.net]][1]. The original XDA looked good, but was expencive, and when the [7650][2] came out, it was trashed. The week i was looking for a new phone, i seen the XDA and was thinking of buying it sim free. it would have cost nearly 800EUR, but would have been cool. then i seen the 7650 for 330EUR. The 7650 was not Sim Free, but still. this XDA 2 sounds good. definatly could be on my christmas list! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
