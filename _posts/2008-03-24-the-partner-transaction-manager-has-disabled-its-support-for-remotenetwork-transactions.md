Right. in the early hours of this morning, I moved my SQL instance to a different box. I also setup a copy of DotNetKicks to run on my network. Unfortunately, this caused some problems with the TransationScope class. unfortunately, i have no remote access to my home machine, so I wont be able to fix it till i get home, but, the information on how to fix this lives [here][1]. Hope this helps someone else!
