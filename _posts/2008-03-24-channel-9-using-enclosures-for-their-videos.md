[Channel 9][1] is now using enclosures for their video feeds. I dont know since when, but i just checked this morning and in the feed there is 2 links as standard (Watch video and download video) so i checked the source and there it was. the enclosure tag! now to hack some code together to get it to download the video automagically and put it into Windows media player. that can save me a lot of time. The code for the Video feed is [here][2]. Hmmm. that is cool.
