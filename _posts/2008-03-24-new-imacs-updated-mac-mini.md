Apple has droped some new (well, updated) products for us today. Firstly 3 updated [iMacs][1], including a new 24&#8243; top end model. Not only that, but they are now using Core 2 Duo chips, meaning 64Bit! Sweet. [TUAW has more including specs][2].&nbsp; next we have the updated [Mac Mini][3]. This now comes with Core Duo (no Core 2) as standard. the original Intel Mac mini only had a Core Duo on the top end. now the low spec one comes with a Core Duo. Still Cant run Aperture though&#8230; [Again, TUAW has more here][4].
