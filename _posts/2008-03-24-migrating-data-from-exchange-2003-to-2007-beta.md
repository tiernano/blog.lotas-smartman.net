Might be a weird question to ask, but does anyone know how to migrate [Exchange 2003][2] data to&nbsp;[Exchange 2007][3]? I am seriously thinking of upgrading the Exchange server in the house to 2007, but i need to know if its posible to copy all my mail to the new server. I would also like to know if its posible to migrate from 2007 BETA to RTM when it comes out. first, i have to get a new server (64 bit) but that will be in good time&#8230;
