Right. my machine is still having some heat problems. the chips are running @ 68Deg C and the main board 41. my HDD is running @ 43. all, except the HDD has a yellow warning on it. im (hopefully) getting more fans on friday. that should help. them chips have a max of 71.5Deg. So, now to get more fans. <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> ill turn it off tonight. ill loose about 4 [work units][1], which is a puty. but i dont want to loose my machine. so its about even.
