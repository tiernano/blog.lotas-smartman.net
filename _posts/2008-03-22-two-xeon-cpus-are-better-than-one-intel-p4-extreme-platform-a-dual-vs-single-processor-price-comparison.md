[Two Xeon CPUs Are Better Than One Intel P4 Extreme Platform &#8211; A Dual Vs. Single Processor Price Comparison][1]. Interesting read. when i was building my workstation last year, i found that 2 Athlon XPs could be [turned into MPs][2] quite easly, and with a lot of ram and a board, worked out cheaper then a P4 running @ about 3Gz (cant remember now what the max was at the time). the P4 was chip only too!
