a PBX is one of those things i dont really need (just like 2 laptops, a 32&#8243; tv, 2 servers, and a dual proc workstation, not to mention 2 phones and multiple PDAs) but its something that would be sweet to have. Check out [this toms networking article showing you how to get Asterisk working][1] as a answephone. i will need some extra hardware if i want to try it, but its handy to have the info!
