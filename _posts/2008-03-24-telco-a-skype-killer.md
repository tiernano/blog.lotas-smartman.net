i found [Telco][1] though [Scobles blog here][2]. Its looks pretty cool. You sign up for a free 30 day trial, they give you a phone number, and also 25 Min of free calls to PSTN lines. The phone number allows you to recieve calls on your computer, but also forward them to an other number. Their service plan is either $4.95 a month with 250 min included, or $2.95 with 150 min included. Most calls to PSTN lines are 2c per min. not bad. I have to try this out. Could be pretty cool!
