Well, this month, i have had 4 hard drives fail on me, and tonight it is the turn of my Proxy server. i was awoken by the BIOS beep of my old IBM server, and it seems that the main hard drive has failed. this actually now means that some of my pages are not showing correctly, one of which is the images site&#8230; i will try and recreate the box virtually tomorrow, but at the moment i need sleep&#8230;
