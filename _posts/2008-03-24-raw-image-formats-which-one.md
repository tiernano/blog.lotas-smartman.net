The most important one was to shoot in raw as much as possible. The problem with that is which format? 

<img src="http://static.flickr.com/34/125390601_eff45a42b4_o.jpg" align="left" alt="Canon CR2" />

At the moment my camera ([Canon EOS 350D][1]) shoots in [Canon&#8217;s][2] own proprietary CR2 format. This can be read my PhotoShop CS2 (with updates) and Apples Aperture and iPhoto. But then there is [Adobes Digital Negativeformat (DNG)][3]. Adobe has released a tool that will convert 100 different RAW formats into, what Adobe is calling an open standard. 

My question is: Should I be backing my RAW images up as CR2 file, DNG  
files, or a mixture of the both? DNG does have the ability to actually include the original RAW image in with the DNG, and includes a preview in JPEG format too.  
Any photographers out there with a comment?
