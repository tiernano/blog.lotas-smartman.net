Apple has released new [MacBook Pros][1] with faster processors, and now the 17&#8243; model has the option of a proper Hi-Def display (1920X1200). The chips now start at 2.2Gz and go to 2.4Gz. As standard both models (15 and 17) come with 2Gb ram, with an option of 4Gb.

The machines now run NVidia Graphics cards (GeForce 8600M GT, with up to 256mb ram). Also, they run 802.11N WiFi and the optical drives have been upgraded to 8x super drives. Bluetooth 2.0+EDR and GigE networking included as standard too. 

I think I may have found what I want for Christmas! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
