I just found out yesterday that the [ESB][1] could be going on strike for more pay, and a 20% stake in the company (currently a semi state body, and theres talk of privatization, i think). Anyway, one of the things that could happen if they do go on strike is rolling blackouts. this is not good for anyone, especially when your running a web server from home. so if stike action is planned and blackouts inevitable, ill be moving my server out side again. talk about a pain in the ass!!!
