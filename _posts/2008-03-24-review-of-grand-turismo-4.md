[Ars Technica have a review of Gran Tursimo 4][1]. This is one of those games i really have to get. I have GT3, and i want GT2 and 1 and even GT4 Prolouge, just to have the whole set. i know GT1 and 2 only work on a PS1, and i have the PS2, but as you know the PS2 plays PS1 games. but before all that i need 1: a job, and 2a: a TV or 2b: My TV card working properly so i can play games on it with sound&#8230;
