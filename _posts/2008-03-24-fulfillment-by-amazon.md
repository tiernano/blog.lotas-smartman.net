Ok, this is not new, but Amazon have a very interesting service, [Fulfillment by Amazon][1]. The idea is quite simple: You send Amazon what ever your selling online. you then sell it (either though them or some other way, like [EBay][2] or your own eStore) and then you tell Amazon to ship the product to your customer. They do the storage, shipping, etc. 1 question though: is there an API? since they have their web services, it would be pretty sweet if, lets say, you shipped all your products to Amazon for shipment, and you could run queries on what they have in stock and how may of each item. Also, if a customer orders something on your site, using your own custom eStore with a [PayPal][3] backend, once the payment has been processed, you could get Amazon to ship immediatly, if not sooner. Just a though&#8230;
