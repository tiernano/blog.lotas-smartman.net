I have just installed IE7 beta 1 on my laptop though the [MSDN][1], and so far, so good. i like the fact that the middle mouse button/scroll wheel actually opens a new tab. it also closes a tab if you click it. very cool stuff. the search bar can be modified too. default is MSN Search, but you can choose from Google, AOL, Ask Jeeves orYahoo. i want to find out how to add a search engine though. Other then that i havent found any problems or new features just yet. i only have it installed 5 minuties though&#8230; dotTEXT works with it, which is nice. [Channel 9 has a video with Chris Jones about Windows Vista][2]. cool stuff. I will probably install Vista on the laptop or in Virtual Server, but the laptop is probably the best bet to get a good idea on real world hardware.
