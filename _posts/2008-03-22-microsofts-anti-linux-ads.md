[microsoft has some &#8220;info&#8221; about the difference between windows and linux][1]. they take a dual Xeon system and an IBM linux mainframe, and prove its cheaper to use windows then linux. of course it is. its a main frame. if you buy your self a dual athlon server (which i paid about 700 euro on) and a copy of [WhiteBoxLinux][2] for free, you can save quite a lot more. its a bit on the funny side. theres a 70 page write up on it, and im still going though it, but the first thing i found is they are running non intel hardware, and secondly they used SUSE Enterprise. now if you used, lets say, a dual Xeon 3Gz with HT and enough ram on linux v windows, im guessing linux should actually win. this is the test we should see, not what microsoft want us to see.
