Just messing around on the OReilly website and found that some of the &#8220;hacks&#8221; series of books&nbsp; have samples on the website. i was looking at a few of these and they are quite handy. there are 8 samples on the [Mac OS X Hacks page][1],&nbsp;8 on the [google hacks page][2], 9 on the [Linux Server Hacks][3], and a list of all [hacks and books here][4].
