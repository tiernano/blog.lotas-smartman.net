[this article talks about][1] the idea of [micropayments][2] and how they will fail because of free content. But that being said, [chris][3] has managed to make money from free content. it says it on [his braintrust!][4] Quote: *Did you know that I turned freely-available content into a $50,000 revenue stream in less than nine months last year?* so, the idea that micropayments are dead is not exactly true. [BitPass][5] is a way of doing this. im thinking of using it for the LSDN. you can have the web based version for free or the PDF Version for about EUR2 or so. just to see if its posible. Work on the LSDN will start soon. just need coffee. what do you think?
