Engadget has some info about a new [3G wifi network router by Cisco-Linksys and Vodafone][1]. Looks pretty interesting, but the problem is the price of 3G data. its not cheap at about EUR82.50 for 100Mb of data, or EUR212.50 for 500Mb. and thats the ex vat prices (add 21% to them costs). and then your charged more for going over the prices&#8230; Ugh. i think i will stick with Cable modem, thank you!
