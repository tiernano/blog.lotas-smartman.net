[Opera for the windows smartphone has been released as a beta][1]. i just downloaded this and, well, its good. very good. What is so good about it? well, i will tell you. first, speed. their&nbsp;[Mobile Accelerator][2]&nbsp;is enabled as standard, so pages are compressed before they are send down the GPRS connection. Also, when scrolling though a page, it is very fast. Pocket IE hits every link on the page before it goes to the next one. with Opera, up and down just scrolls up and down. left and right hit the links. very cool when&nbsp;a page has a nav bar at the top and you dont want to hit all the links. so, this is pretty cool anyway. i am very happy so far, my page looks grand in the opera browser, and it navigatable with opera too. Check it out!
