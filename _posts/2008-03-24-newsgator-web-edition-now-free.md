[NewsGator][1], the guys who make the NewsGator news reader for outlook, have just made their online news reader free. its the basic version, but its pretty cool. Their premium stuff (Premium, dude!! Sorry, simpsons quote) looks really cool, like the phone access. Also, i like the syncing with PCs and stuff. so i could have newsgator on my laptop and my workstation at home, and they sync automagically with each other, and then i can read news on my phone or PDA, and they will be marked as read on the laptop and PC. All pretty cool! Being a geek though and playing with RSS feeds, in theory i could try this out and build my own software for this, but time wise, i dont have a lot. Anyway, check it out.
