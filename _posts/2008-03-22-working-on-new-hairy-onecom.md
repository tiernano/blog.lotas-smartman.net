Ok. Im working on a new version of [The hairy one][1]. Not sure what to do to it, but im going to start with CSS. Im already using CSS in the site now, but i want to add some more, mainly for the outline of it. Im also looking at a different colour sceeme, a new logo, and i want to advertise my mail service more. By the way, talking about mail service, check out [The hairy-one.com mail!!][2] 6MB free webspace, and stuff. So im now looking at a CSS tutorial i got from [W3Schools][3]. Im also trying [Dreamweaver MX][4]. It may help me more!! **[update]** Is it wrong to set the default size of the site to be 1024X768 or would that be normal?
