[Gmail agent][1] is a C# project, with code, that allows you to get updates when you have new gmail! pretty cool idea. Works well too. there is also an API for this so you can use it to do other things. one of the other neat features is an address importer, so all your contacts can be imported to Gmail! and finally, it includes code. only catch. Google dont want people to reverse engineer their code, so i dont know how long this will last&#8230; Still great tool. found on [Sonu Kapoor&#8217;s][2] blog.
