[This is a cool show off application][1] for [Amazon&#8217;s S3][2] (the [Amazon Simple Storage Service][3]). It downloads your images from [Flickr][4] (another cool site) and uploads them to the S3 servers. One tool i want to write would be an app that syncs images from either [iPhoto][5] (on the mac) or [Microsoft Digital Imaging Suite 10][6]. I only use iPhoto on the mac at the moment because i cant get Digital Imaging Suite 10 to read RAW images from my Canon EOS350D. Anyway, the S3 gives me great ideas. just need time to build them!
