now this is an extreamly interesting idea. [scanR][1]&nbsp;takes a photo you send  
it, and turns it into a searchable PDF file. I cant try this on a camera phone,  
as i dont have the 1Mpixel camera required, but i will try this with a proper  
camera soon and see how well it works. Very interesting and cool!
