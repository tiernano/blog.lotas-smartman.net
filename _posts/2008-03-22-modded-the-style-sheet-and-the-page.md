right. i have fixed the page. there was a problem with users with browsers @ 1024X768 resolution. its now fixed, i think, but users @ 800X600 is still broked. ill fix that, if its posible. also, things have been moved around. the side bar is on the right, and the content is now on the left. what do you think?
