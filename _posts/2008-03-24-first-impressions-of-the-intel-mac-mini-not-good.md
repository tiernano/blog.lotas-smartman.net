The unofficial apple weblog has a quick [&#8220;first impressions&#8221; post about the new mac mini][1], and their first impressions are not good. they are concidering bringing it back to apple&#8230; This is interesting. did apple jump the gun on this one? Is it just a dud machine? i am still thinking of getting one, but it there are a lot of problems (which hopefully others will find over the next few weeks), i will be changing my mind&#8230;
