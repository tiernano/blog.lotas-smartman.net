[this page][1] has info on setting up your own NOC (Network Operations Center). i want one of these! i think i have enough machines, just need monitors and a dual headed graphics card. only got 1 17&#8243; monitor, but about 3 14&#8243; ones, a 15&#8243; and an imac. This could be fun! pity yhere are no photos.
