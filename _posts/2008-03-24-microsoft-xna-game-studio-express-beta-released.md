[Microsoft XNA Game Studio Express][1] (BETA) released, the game development suite, has been released. This is cool. At the moment, developing on Vista doesent work (it will eventually) and XBox 360 support is not there either (or retail 360 support). Very handy. cant wait to play with this! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
