[Coral][1] is a new P2P Web Cache thing that allows you to get webpages from local caches, rather then the main site. its kind of like [Akamai][2] but run free and run on users hardware, not Akamais. Pretty cool idea. So, what does this mean to my blog? Well, check out <http://blog.lotas-smartman.net.nyud.net:8090> for the Coralized version of my blog! Now to work on coralizing some other parts like images, CSS, etc. Also, i want to make a coral P2P node on my lan for speed and helping of the network. wonder if there will be a windows build of this soon? [update] most images (except smilies) are now Coralized and so are the CSS files. due to a technical difficulty with the templates i cant make the HTML pages coralized. but other then that its cool!
