Ok. i found a comment on my [programming blog][1] asking what the status of RSSAgg was. well, i [replied to the question][2] and im hoping to start coding this weekend. one of the features i was thinking of adding is was support for mini devices like palm tops and smartphones. im not sure weather to create pages for this (HTML or WML) and an app for windows devices or to create just the pages. im thinking more along the lines of the windows devices one too. more info when i figure out what it will do! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Hopefully RSSAgg will stop crossposting too! a single RSS Feed for the whole site for ease of reading, etc. this is what i wanted before i started the project, so hopefully i will have time over the weekend to do so.
