I am sitting in my car at the moment and have something I want to talk about, that only comes out well over audio. I need something that I can use that will record in mp3 format, or wav, and that is easily portable, hands free, and has a good audio pick up. ideally I want a device that I can set to record, with a mic sitting on the dash or sun visor, that will record anything I want it to. any ideas? I tried with the pocket pc, but it canâ€™t write to sd fast enough. maybe a faster sd card would be cool. I also tried the zen micro, but the mic isent the best. anyone know of a good portable recording unit?
