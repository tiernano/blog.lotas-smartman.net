Right. im just installing Visual Studio 2003 Enterprise from the MSDN now and same with VS 6 Enterprise. Downloading the SP5 for VS6, comming in at 80 &#8211; 120k a second. Thats mad cause my conenction is ment to be 600Kbits/s. that works out, by my calculations at a max of 75k/s. but im reaching 80 &#8211; 120! Wahoo! thats upto 60% Faster. i did nothing. thats [NTL][1] for you. pretty cool! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> So, im going to play with VS.net for testing and see what i can do.
