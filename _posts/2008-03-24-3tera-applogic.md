There is a 10min [AppLogic demo][2] which, when I seen it first, blew me away, but also, made me ask some questions. more on that a bit later. <img src="http://images.lotas-smartman.net/image.ashx?id=f511f00d-a07c-403a-874c-c379215365cf" align="left" /> 

&nbsp;There is another company, called [Grid Layer][3], which offer solutions using the 3Tera software. They sell Virtual Private Datacenters, which start at about a grand a month. For that, you get 4 machines, each with a 2.4Gz processor, 2Gb ram, 6Tb bandwidth, a total of 32 ip addresses and the software required. 

The way the software is build is around virtual appliances. You have your 4 machines running the AppLogic software, and all report info to the main machine. you then say I want 4 web servers, 2 App servers and a DB server. each of these virtual machines are then started and run on the different boxes. cool idea.

So, the questions I wanted to ask. I Still cant find a price for the software, and with software like this, I am guessing it is not free. Second, why don&#8217;t we have anything like this for Windows?&nbsp; since this is based around Virtual Machines, in reality it shouldn&#8217;t be impossible. yea, licensing may get in the way, but, licensing aside, how hard could it be?</p>
