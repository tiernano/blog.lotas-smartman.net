Click the photo below for more photos of my new PowerEdge 1600SC. Just finished installing Win2k3 server and SP1 on it. i have ordered an extra 512mb DIMM for it this morning too, which will hopefully be here by the weekend, so i can get my Exchange server back up and running. I have also been looking for a second processor for it, just because i can. It is currently acting as a proxy for my network using [Proxy+][1]. Very cool stuff!
