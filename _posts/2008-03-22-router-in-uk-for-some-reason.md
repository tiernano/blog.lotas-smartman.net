My router seems to be in the UK for some strange reason. It arrived there at 12min past midnight on the 26 of march, and hasent moved since. it was ment to be here now! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> i want my router! Also, i missed the aptitude test. got stuck in traffic, and then lost! So, now i have to, hopefully, do it tomorrow. i hope my router is actually in ireland, and will be here soon.
