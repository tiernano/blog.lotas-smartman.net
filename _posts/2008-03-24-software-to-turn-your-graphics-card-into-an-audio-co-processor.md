[this extreamtech article][1] talks about a company, [BionicFX][2], who are working on a peice of software that will use your NVidia graphics card&#8217;s GPU for sound processing. interesting idea. personally speaking, the sound processing idea is a bit useless to me, but if someone can get it to do other things, it would be quite cool!
