[Digg has a post about XP Pro booting on&nbsp;Mac][1]. this looks interesting. unfortunitly, the Digg effect has taken the linking sites down, [but the original article is here][2], and there are some [photos of the mac booting windows here.][3] If this is true, there is one more reason to by me a mac mini, and i hope it can dual boot! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
