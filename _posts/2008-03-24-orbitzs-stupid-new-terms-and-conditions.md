Orbitz (which im not linking to because of their stupid terms and conditions, which im also not linking to, but are linked to [here on [slashdot][1]][2]) now require you to write to them if you want to link to them. also, deep linking, which would be linking to a page 2 or 3 pages in from their front page, is baned, totally. How stupid is that?
