Before anyone thinks its because im running windows 2003 server at home, your wrong. there is a known hardware issue with my server (one of the 3 128mb dimms is bad) and i havent had a chance to work out which one, or replace it, plus its PC100 RAM, and i cant find it cheap anywhere (i can get 512mb DDR ECC ram for the PowerEdge for the same price as 128mb for the web server). Anyway, todays downtime was a power outage. I am replacing the web server soon (hopefully a few weeks) but until then, im trying to work out stuff&#8230;
