Ok. i have just reasized how hard rebuilding my network is actually going to be. I have to backup Exchange (which is already done, and i have a 1.3Gb file from that) to a DVD, then format and install Windows 2003 Small Buisness Edition on to that same machine. Once thats done, i have to unbackup exchange, setup my domain, ISA, and everything else (including installing updates) then, get IIS working on that machine or a virtual machine so i can take my web and SQL server down, backup, format, test the ram (it keeps crashing randomly, which i think is a ram problem), install win2k3 server, and join the domain, get acting as a web server again, get the site back on to it, install SQL 2000 and 2005 on to it, and some other things i want there too, and then , get my workstation and laptop back on the domain! This is starting to be one of those ideas i wish i hadent have had&#8230;
