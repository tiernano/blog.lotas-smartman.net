<p mce_keep="true">Right, so last night i got invited to Xobni by <a href="http://coolthingoftheday.blogspot.com/" mce_href="http://coolthingoftheday.blogspot.com/">Greg</a> over at Greg&#8217;s Cool [Insert Clever Name] of the Day (Thanks Greg!) and now i have 5 invites to give out. Since my comments are turned off due to spam, drop me a mail at tierno [at] lotas-smartman [dot] net and if i still have invites, i will send them out. Once i play around with this a bit more, i will post my findings&#8230;&nbsp;Xobni, by the way is Inbox backwards! heh. [update] make that 4&#8230; one already gone. [update] make that 2 gone, 3 to go!</p>
