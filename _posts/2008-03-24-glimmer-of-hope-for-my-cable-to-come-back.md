Ok. i was just talking to home and it looks like the TV is working, but the cable modem is dead still. it did work for a few seconds eirler on, but then it died again. hopefully there is someone working on it, so thats a good thing. one problem. today and tomorrow Ireland is meant to be attacked by storms and the weather agencys are expecting major structurial dammage and more problems, etc. so even if the cable comes up, it could kill power! so i will leave the site out side for the next few days, and hopefully when all this is over and done with, we should be grand. lets hope its soon!
