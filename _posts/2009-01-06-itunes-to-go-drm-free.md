So, again, like my last post, this is a &#8220;live&#8221; post. posting as i read it.

Apple has announced that their iTunes store will now have 3 prices for songs. $0.69, $0.99 and $1.29.

they have sold 6 billion songs, and have 10 millions songs in their library.

75 million accounts with Credit Cards&#8230;

by the end of this quarter, [all 10million songs will be DRM Free][1]. iTunes plus is higher quality (256kb v 128kb). (wondering if i can upgrade my entire library&#8230; cheaply)&#8230;

today, 8 million of those songs will be DRM Free (i noticed this just a few min ago&#8230; a lot of songs and albums are showing this already&#8230;)

iTunes wifi store on the iphone, now not just limited to Wifi! Will work over 3G&#8230; that starts today.

no idea how the pricing works&#8230; based on photos from Engadget, looks like its songs over 6 years old which will be $0.69 but could also be $0.99 and $1.29&#8230; and new songs (0-6 years) will be $0.99&#8230; very odd&#8230; starts April 1 2009&#8230;

Thats that for now!

[update] just upgraded 49 songs in my library (including 2 albums) for $11.90. not bad. all now DRM Free! SWEET!
