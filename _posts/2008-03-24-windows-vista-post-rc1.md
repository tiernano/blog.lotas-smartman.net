So, i had been running <a HREF="/archive/2006/05/23/12518.aspx">Vista BETA 2</a> on my main workstation for a while now, and i finally got to upgrade to the <a HREF="/archive/2006/09/22/14345.aspx">Post RC 1 build (5728)</a> with <a HREF="/archive/2006/09/14/14026.aspx">Office 2007 B2TR</a> as well. a few things i have noticed: 

1: I was having crasing issues with going into Admin Mode (UAC i think its called, the yellow shield) and it was really annoying me. it only seemed to happen in the first 10min of the system booting. i upgraded the graphics drivers ([NVidia][1] have drivers for Vista RC1 + and i installed them) and now everything seems grand.

2: The <a HREF="/archive/2006/09/23/14346.aspx">2 Dell Monitors</a> i have both have USB ports on them. only thing is Vista does not see these. If i plug in a USB key or a mouse, i get nothing. Hopefully drivers will be released soon. 

3: Seems faster. cant give speed estimates agenst RC1 since i never ran it on this box, but its faster at most things compaired to BETA 2. 

So far so good!&nbsp;More on it later if i find out anything else more interesting.
