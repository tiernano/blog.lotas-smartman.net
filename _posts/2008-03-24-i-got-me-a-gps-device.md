I orded a GPS a few days ago, and it arrived this morning before i left for work. very cool. its a [Socket bluetooth GPS device][1]. I havent gotten it fully working just yet (only charged it for half an hour while driving to work) and i havent been out side long enough for it to get a proper position of where i am (because its raining and i dont want me or the devices to get wet). but hopefully over the weekend i can play with it fully. Also, check out this [Coding4Fun article showing you how to use a GPS device in C# and VB.NET][2]. Very cool stuff. i have gotten it working and i can watch the data streaming off the com port. Anyway, i will be posting more stuff when i find it.
