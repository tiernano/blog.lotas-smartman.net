[Microsoft creating Windows for supercomputers &#8211; News &#8211; ZDNet][1]. thats going to be cool. as long as you can write a an app for a HPC server under VB.NET, C# and C++, the amount of HPC programmers are going to increese, and with more cheap power, its going to help business a lot. this is one thing i though Microsoft should have done a while ago. It would be cool to have a cluster of 40 win2k3 servers running as one large SQL server or one large exchange server. Ohhh! and its not just servers! im just reading a little more and it says about desktop systems running this. that could be a lot cooler. encoding a DVD and using a few more machines on the network to do encoding! sweet.
