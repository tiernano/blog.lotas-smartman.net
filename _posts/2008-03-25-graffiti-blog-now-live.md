Its taken the last couple of hours, but Finally, the blog is now Running [Graffiti][1]! [Community Server][2] has good, while it lasted, but it started to get too big to manage. Graffiti is now nice and small, and portable! I would like to Thank [Jayme Davis][3] over at [Telligent][4] for helping me with some problems, and [Jason Alexander][5], also of Telligent, for pointing me in his direction!
