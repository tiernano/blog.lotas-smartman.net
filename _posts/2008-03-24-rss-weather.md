[RSS Feed for Dublin Airport Ireland weather][1]. This is cool. now, in theory, i can have an updated feed telling me how weather will be. though for the last few days it has done nothing but rain! Tipical! the week i take off for my holidays and it pisses rain all week. last week the sun was splitting the stones, and next week it will probably be the same. Damn weather!
