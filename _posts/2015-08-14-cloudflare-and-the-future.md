So, you may have noticed that the site has been up and down a bit for the last day or so... And now its over SSL. Well, thats because now this site is hosted 
behind [CloudFlare][1] with SSL and [SPDY][2] enabled. But thats just one part of this post...

Looking at the sites i run, i have decided to make some changes. The sites running are:

* [tiernanotoole.ie][3] which is a technical blog and my main email account
* [blog.lotas-smartman.net][4] which is this site, the oldest site i have. Email is still on here, but its more a legacy site...
* [geekphotographer.com][5] is a photography released blog with a technical side
* [tiernanotoole.net][6] which will be a more network related site (not live yet)
* [tiernanotoolephotography.com][7] which will host my photograpy stuff, more business than technical...
* [miniblog.tiernanotoole.net][10], a [Tumblr][11] site for quick content, more "personal" than tech and mostly photos...

there are a few more (well, 30 or so domains!) but it would take too long to explain, and i cant even remember what half of them are or where...

So, this site, going forward, will be more "Long Form" posts, much like the [5+ Screens and a Cloud][8] post from 2011. future posts like the [Using Dropbox 
as a personal Git and Mercurial Storage area][9] post will probably go to [tiernanotoole.ie][3] and then shorter quick posts will live on the 
[miniblog.tiernanotoole.ie][10].

all the blogs have RSS feeds to subscribe to, so if you want to subscribe, go forth and do so... Thanks.
