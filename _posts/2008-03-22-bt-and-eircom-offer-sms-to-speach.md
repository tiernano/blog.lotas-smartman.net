[this mac world report][1] talks about how BT have managed to setup a system to allow users to send a SMS message to a landline, and an electronic voice read it out. its been here for a while though, so its not new. heard about it for the first time yesterday, but also heard its been here for ages. sounds weird. works great though. handy for sending messages to partents who cant read text messages!
