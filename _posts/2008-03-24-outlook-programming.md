I might have posted this before, but check out this [MSDN article showing you how to program agenst Outlook][1]. i want to play with this just for fun. I want to write an app that goes though all my email in Outlook, and works out some stats (yes im a geek). So i will be playing with this over the next few day and might be posting some extra code.
