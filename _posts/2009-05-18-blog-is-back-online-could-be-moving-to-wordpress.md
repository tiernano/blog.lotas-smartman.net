So, this morning, my Proliant server decided that its secondary hard drive was dead, and all my VMs that where running on that box (my ISA/TMG server included) went away&#8230; not good&#8230;. and to make matters worse, i have been sick all day&nbsp;too&#8230;. AND (it gets worse) my CDN (SimpleCDN) has been dead for the last few days also&#8230; its not going well&#8230; So, i finally started work on the upgrade to&nbsp;the blog. My TMG server is back online.&nbsp;My CSS and JS&nbsp;files and some images are&nbsp;now being hosted by Mosso&nbsp;using&nbsp;the Limelight&nbsp;CDN (SWEET!) and i am starting to look at WordPress&nbsp;for my hosting needs (now that it will work on win2k8 and IIS&nbsp;without much of a problem). &nbsp;Sorry for the long time getting back into blogging&#8230; been lazy. you can follow me though on Twitter ([@tiernano][1])
