[slashdot][1] are repoting that Australian ISP iiNET, are [offering 8mb/s  
broadband connections now][2], and are to offer 20mb/s connections soon. This is  
cool. There is [more on  
Whirlpool][3], the article linked to in the [slashdot][1] article.the 8mb sevice is  
capable of 1mb/s upload speed, which is nice. Download cap is strange though.  
the low price service gives you 2gb peak and 2Gb off peak downloads. the next  
one up offers 40Gb peak, and 40Gb off peak. i would prefer no cap though. 1mb a  
sec up in nice though&#8230;.
