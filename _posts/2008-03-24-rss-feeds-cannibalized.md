Right, due to some websites using MY RSS feed to make money for them, i have had to modify the RSS feed to only show the first 300 characters. I am sorry for this, but it is because of the few, not the many. I really hate to do this, and if your pissed off at me, i don&#8217;t blame you. Please leave comments with your remarks.

[update] I have removed this! Back to the normal RSS Feeds. Sorry for the dual post, and probably confusing your RSS Readers. I am just going to do some work with my RSS Feeds, the same way [Scott Hanselman][1] has his (copyright notice at the bottom of the feed).</p>
