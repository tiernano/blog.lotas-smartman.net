A couple of months back, i wondered about <a href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/archive/2007/08/15/inbound-sms-numbers.aspx" mce_href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/archive/2007/08/15/inbound-sms-numbers.aspx">getting SMS messages into a system for processing</a>. I found a few services, but they cost money, and lots. I know Gavin over at <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com" mce_href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com">DotNetKicks</a> had software for this, but i think my spam filters decided to kill it&#8230; and i havent had a chance to email him back (Gav, if your listening, hint hint!). Anyway, i found this system over at Linux Devices: its called an <a href="http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS2761247659.html" mce_href="http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS2761247659.html">Acme FoxBox SMS</a>(Acme, as in Buggs bunny and Willie Coyote! cool!) anyway, there is a second one which is designed for MMS Messages, called the <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS7776457350.html" mce_href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS7776457350.html">FoxBox MMS</a>. Both run Linux (hence being on Linux Devices) and seem to be fairly hackable (run custom software when text or mms messages come in). Thing is the price: the SMS version is EUR750 (about $1060), and the MMS Version is EUR880 (about $1240). But still, this is cool!
