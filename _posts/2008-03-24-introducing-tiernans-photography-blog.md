Ok. i have been bitten by the photography bug. and its the kind of bug that i cant hit with a hammer and kill. it keeps jumping around the place and i miss, and hit something else. but enough of that. i have been messing around with photography for a while now, and i read a fair amount of stuff online about it at this stage. so instaed of annoyting (or confusing) some my readers on this blog (and vise versa) i have created a [blog dedicated to photography][1]. it will hopefully be teamed with a main photography site which will have more stuff soon (photo galery, tips, tricks, links, maybe a forum, etc). 

hopefully over the next few days i will get to put some cool stuff up there, and here while i am working on stuff. untill then, good luck!
