Right. i have my PC now running windows and my mac running OSX, and the both now have [iTunes 4.2][1]. So, i have about 20 cds to rip to my computer, just because i can, and [Rendezvous][2] music sharing is handy. this got me thinking. rip one Cd on the mac, one on the pc and share the music. only thing i found out though. the mac is ripping at a speed of 2.2X, which the PC, which is about 6X Faster, is ripping @ 13X. this does make sence though. Given that the PC is a dual 2Gz Athlon, only using one chip under itunes though, and the mac is a single G3 333Mhz, the pc wins just because of power. still. the mac is nice.
