I was just reading Scott Watermasysk&#8217;s site, and in this post he says that [dotTEXT  
is not dead][1]! I am really glad to hear that. there is a list of new features  
that i cant wait to get my hands on, so when ever community server 1.0 is  
released, i will be happy. and there will be an upgrade script too! SWEET!
