Ok. i got my new case and set it up, but there are a few minor problems with it. 1: The size. its nearly 2 foot bigger then the old cases and therefor wont fit in the same place as the old ones. so its now sitting in the middle of the floor. also becasue its so tall, there is a problem with cables. the IDE Cable on my machine is only long enough to reach to a certin point. and when it does, its only one connector. there are 2 drives, and one connector. so im down a CDR Drive at the moment. and finally, all the fan mounts are for 80mm fans. i only have 2 90mm fans! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> now to get new fans and larger cables!
