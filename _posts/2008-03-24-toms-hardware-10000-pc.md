Well, Toms hardware is 10 years old, so they decided to build a [10 grand machine][2] to celerbrate this.&nbsp;the only problem: its not what i would be spending 10 grand on. Its only got a single Dual core CPU, 4Gb ram, and only about 800GB hdd (ONLY, but i would want more&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> ) but it does have 4 graphics cards, and a 30&#8243; display. but, as i said, i would want something a little more powerfull in the CPU side of things, not graphics. now, Dual proc, dual Core Xeon or Opteron, with 8+Gb RAM, a few terabytes of HDD, and a couple of those 30&#8243; displays would be more by thing&#8230;.
