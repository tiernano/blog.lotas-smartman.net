Check out this article showing you [how to build a 1Tb file server for about $500][1]. [[via Digg][2]] I looked into this a while back and found that 320Gb is around the sweet spot for a good Gig/EUR. it works out that its a good 20 &#8211; 30c less expencive per Gig for a 320Gb compaired to a 500Gb.
