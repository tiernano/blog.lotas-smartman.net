I found [this article][1]  
over on [Keven Rose.com][2]&nbsp;showing you  
how he managed to put a PC into a [Mac  
Mini][3] Case. He uses a Nano ITX case with a VIA 1GHz&nbsp;Nehimiah Processor.  
Interesting idea, but really. a fried on mine has a VIA C3 system running at  
about 700Mhz, i think, and he hates the thing. i dont know about the new  
Nehimiah chip, but i would prefer the G4&#8230;
