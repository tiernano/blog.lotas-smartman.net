long live the new exchange server, when ever i get it. I got my replacement fans for the servers today, and when i took the old fan out of the exchange box and put in the new one, the machine just kept rebooting with no display. So, i took out the ram, and put in different ram, still no booting. i changed graphics cards, still no luck. i took out the hard drive and CDRom, and they dident help either. So, now i have a not so expencive, but fairly heavy paperweight. I do, how ever, have a backup of all my email and contacts, which i nice. Now to get my new servers. Im thinking 2 dell PowerEdge SC430&#8217;s with 2.8Gz P4s, 512mb ram (to start with, dell charge an arm and a leg for RAM, i can get it cheaper else where) and 80Gb hdd (again, arm, leg, cheaper elsewhere, etc). Only thing is i dont know when this will happen. I really havent a clue what the hell is wrong with this thing. its a bit of a pain though&#8230;
