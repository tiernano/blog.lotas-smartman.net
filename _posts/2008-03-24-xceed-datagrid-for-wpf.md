Now, when i heard about this a few weeks back, i though, meh. interesting, but meh. I had not seen any demos of it or though of what it could do. Then this morning, i clicked the [link to the demo][1]&nbsp;(might not load immediatly, and may take some time), and when it fully loaded, and i started to play around i actually was speachless! Its called [DataGrid for WPF][2]&nbsp;and its rocks! Ohhh, and its FREE. I am not sure if its using the [WPF/E][3] (Windows Presentation Foundation, Everywhere) so it may only work on IE, but if it is Everywhere, i may be using this for something&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
