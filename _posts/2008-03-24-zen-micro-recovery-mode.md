I have had my Zen Micro for a while now, and i have noticed it getting slower and slower as time goes by. this is mainly because of the podcasts i use it with. Every week i load about 150mb of podcasts (maybe more) and every other day, previously listened to ones are removed. leaving chunks of days split all over the place. Well, there is a [tip i found over here telling you how to get to the recovery menu][1]:

<font face="Verdana" size="2"><em>There&#8217;s a hidden &#8216;Recovery&#8217; menu that lets you defragment or format the hard drive, reboot, or reload the firmware. This is for advanced use only, and you&#8217;re advised not to play around with these options unless you know what you&#8217;re doing.<br />To access this, take out the battery, hold the switch in the &#8216;on&#8217; position, and with this held to &#8216;on&#8217;, reinsert the battery. A menu will appear. </em></font>

Handy for thouse of you who have a Zen. Clean up, i think, is defrag, fromat is what it says on the tin, and same with the rest. handy!
