Check out my [Konspire][1] channgel: <a HREF="http://localhost:8085/keyAdd?channel=lsn+blog&#038;keyURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elotas-smartman%2Enet%2Flsnblog%2Ekey&#038;keySourceURL=http%3A%2F%2Fblog%2Elotas-smartman%2Enet">subscribe to lsn blog</a>. You need konspire installed before that works. once its installed, click the link above. my blog will be broad cast over that soon. Pretty neet! if that link above doesent work, go to the [home page][2] and click on subscriptions. the channel name is LSN Blog and the key URL is** http://www.lotas-smartman.net/lsnblog.key**. That should then work. Hopefully. ill post stuff to it now. this will still be the main site, just testing this other thing.
