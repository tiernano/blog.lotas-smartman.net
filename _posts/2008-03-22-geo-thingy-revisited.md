I know its not called geothingy, but i like that name and thats what i called it the last time!!! Its actually [GeoBlog][1]. Its a cool idea. you post, it pops up in flash and says where its from. you can view this in any flash enabled web browser. im trying it out again. the last time i had no [GeoTags][2] in my blog. i had them, but while i was playing with new themes, i lost them. I just added them to this theme, so it should work. ill check and update when i find out! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />** [Update]** It worked!!! wahoo!! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
