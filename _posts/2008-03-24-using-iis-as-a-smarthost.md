[this article over at the lazy admin shows you how to use IIS as a smarthost][1] for your mail. Interesting read. He says he is using his because his mail server is underpowered and the IIS box can be used to remove spam and viruses before hitting the exchange box. well in my case, its the other way around, but still an interesting article.
