Now thats what im talking about! [this test over at toms hardware][1] takes a Dual Xeon system, 4 8 port serial ATA controlers, and 32 hard drives and creates a raid 50 array and a raid 0 array (raid 50 being 2 raid 5 arrays striped over each other). man! nice. they use 7200RPM drives, but i wonder if it would be faster with 10000RPM drives, or are they maxing out the bus or cards at 7200RPM. i thats a nice system to have. i wonder if i could get me one of them&#8230;. where the hell would i put 32 hard drives though&#8230;
