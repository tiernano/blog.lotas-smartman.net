> > *&#8220;[Dean Edwards][1] has takenit upon himself to make Internet Explorer W3C compliant. How? Well, itisn&#8217;t by patching the application, as you might suspect. He&#8217;s [created a stylesheet, dubbed &#8216;IE7&#8242; ][2]thatuses DHTML to load and parse style sheets into a form that IE canunderstand. Just include the style sheet in your HTML pages, and thingsshould render correctly. The complexity of the CSS transformations isreally amazing and shows off the power of this stuff.&#8221;&#8221;*</p>
