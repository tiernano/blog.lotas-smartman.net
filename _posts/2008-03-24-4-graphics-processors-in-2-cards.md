[Toms hardware is playing with 2 Asus Extream 7800 GT Dual cards][1], which each have 2 7800GT Graphics processors and 512mb ram. with the proper board, you can run 2 of these monsters in a system, with a graphics power of 4 processors and 1Gb ram! I dont play games, but&nbsp;i definatly want&nbsp;2 of these! if you disable the SLI support, and only use each processor to power a single monitor, you can have your self a very nice system with 4 massive monitors (Dell 24&rdquo; wide screens&hellip;. SWEET).
