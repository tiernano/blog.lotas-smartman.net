OK. so, im installing windows 2000 on my old server, the one that is currently a Linux box. its the 700Mhz Duron, and will get an upgrade from 256mb ram to 384mb. As i said, windows 2000 server will be installed on this, but not sure what else yet. Then, once thats installed, my current windows 2003 server is comming down, getting an reinstall of 2k3 server (domain issues with exchange. cant figure it out yet..) and Exchange 2000 is being installed on that. ISA will go back on and the whole thing will be running some time after i start. hopefully no downtime will be seen by you. then, i can start on the moving from [WordPress][1] to [.TEXT][2]. wish me luck.
