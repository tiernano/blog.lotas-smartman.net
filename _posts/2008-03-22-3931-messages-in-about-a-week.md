Man. i have been using IMAP on Outlook Express for the last few days cause i was to lazy to get my old mozilla mail box working again. well the backup copy of my mail is dead. dident work. I still have it, so if anyone knows how to get the mail from mozilla out of the mail box and into something else, like an other mail box, and hopefully my settings and stuff, i would be quite happy. anyway, since i was using imap, all my mail stayed on the server. and i just downloaded it. there was a total of over 3900 emails! thats only for the last week. started 14 August! its now 21! 7 DAYS!!! Thats a lot of mail. dont know how much is spam yet. will find out soon though!!
