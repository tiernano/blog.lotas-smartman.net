[Business week is reporting that Microsoft are cliping Longhorn][1] meaning that some of the features that where ment to be in Longhorn wont be there, but are being put back to Blackcomb. WinFS wont be fully there, and something to do with the DRM. Pity. Still theres lots of new things in Longhorn that will be cool to check out.
