from the [slashdot article here][1]: &nbsp;*&#8220;This article is the first in a series by William von Hagen on *[*using the new Linux 2.6 kernel*][2]*, with a special emphasis on the primary issues in migrating existing drivers, applications, and embedded Linux deployments to a Linux distribution based on the 2.6 kernel. Bill is the author of Linux Filesystems, Hacking the TiVo, SGML for Dummies, Installing Red Hat Linux 7, and is the coauthor of The Definitive Guide to GCC (with Kurt Wall) and The Mac OS X Power Users Guide (with Brian Profitt).&#8221;*
