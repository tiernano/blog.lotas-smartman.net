        On behalf of the entire Pocket PC Thoughts team, a very happy Easter to those of you who celebrate it, and a restful Sunday to the rest. <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> We typically take Easter off, so we&#8217;ll be back to full posting speed tomorrow. In the meantime, Kent over at Digital Media Thoughts pointed out that McDeb&#8217;s Pocket PC skin site has some great Easter themes if you want to put your Pocket PC in the mood. Enjoy. <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
