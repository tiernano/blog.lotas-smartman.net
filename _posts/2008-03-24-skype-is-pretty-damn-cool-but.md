i have just had a meeting with a friend of mine in Spain over [skype][1]. he was on ADSL, im on Cable. we where talking for a total of 3 hours! its unbelevable sound quality. but, heres the problem. i would like some sort of screen sharing in Skype. he wanted to show me something on his machine, so we ended up installing VNC on his machine, opening ports on his firewall and me connecting to his machine that way. now, if skype had it working, securly, it would make life a lot easer! anyway, thats enough of that. someone robbed another hour on me again. it was 1am and then it suddenly became 2am. ahhh well&#8230;
