I have heard stuff about this [JSON][1] thing (JavaScript Object Notation) but never went into a lot of reading about it, until today. Today I found the [Futef][2]&nbsp;API, which allows you to query Wikipedia. The returned format is JSON (hence the title of this post). Very cool stuff. So, since my language of choice for programming is C#, I found [Json.NET From Newtonsoft][3]: A C# JSON Serializer and Deserializer. Very cool!
