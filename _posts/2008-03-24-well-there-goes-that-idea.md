A while back [i said i was thinking of doing a network upgrade][1] where i would be getting a nice 64bit Athlon 64 system which i was going to get working as a dedicated exchange box. Well, it looks like [Exchange 2003][2] wont work with [windows 2003 x64 edition][3], and might not&#8230; I think i was just under the impression that exchange only needed some minor modifications to run on a 64bit system, but this [post over at &#8220;You had me at EHLO&#8230;&#8221; says its not that easy][4]. Which is unfortunite. In think in theory i will get the 64bit machine anyway, install the 32bit version of windows 2003 and the standard copy of Exchange and use it for a while. when a 64bit version of exchange comes out, then i can do the upgrade.
