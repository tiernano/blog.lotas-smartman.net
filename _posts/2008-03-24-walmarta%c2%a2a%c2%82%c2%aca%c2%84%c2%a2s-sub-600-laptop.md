this engadget article, [WalmartÃ¢â¬â¢s sub-$600 laptop][1], talks about, well walmarts sub $600 laptop. for under $600 you get a pretty decient machine. 128mb ram is pretty bad for a windows XP box, but for an extra $100 or so you could throw in a 512mb dimm like i did with my Dell. Sounds like a good deal!
