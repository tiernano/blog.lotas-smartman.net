I have noticed since i moved my serve &#8220;in house&#8221; that the site seems a lot faster! not sure if it means more visitors to the site, since i would guess if the site is taking a long time (5 seconds or more) to load, a lot of people go back or go somewhere else. We will see how this week stacks up agenst last week in total hits. nice way to start a week though, heay?
