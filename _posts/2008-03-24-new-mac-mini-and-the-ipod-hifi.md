Apple has just released 2 new products: the new, Intel powered, Mac mini. now with a Core single or Core Duo processor, starting at 599 for a single core chip, or 799 with the core duo. takes 2 memory modules (a lot better then the old 1Dimm socket) and has some more features.[ more from apple here][1]. Also, the iPod Hi-Fi. not interested in this, so [read up about it your selfs if you are here][2]. I am definatly interested in the new Mac Mini.
