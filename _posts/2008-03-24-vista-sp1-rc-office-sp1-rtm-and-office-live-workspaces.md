Running Vista on your machine? Want to check out the SP? [SP1 RC is available to download here][1]. this is quite a small download, at a little over 300k, and it downloads SP1 over Windows Update. 

Next is [SP1 of Office 2007][2]. Its a little bigger, at 218.3mb. Great work lads!

And finally, [Office Live Workspaces][3] are now live. it should just be a matter of signing up and getting access. Very cool stuff!
