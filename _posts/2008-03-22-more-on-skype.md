[this new york times article][1] (registration MAY be reuqired, not sure, got the link off slashdot and their all mad over there and have some ways around it!) has some info about [Skype][2]: the P2P VoIP system. Very cool write up. cool quote:  


> Even Mr. Zennstrom, 37, and Mr. Friis, 27, say they are surprised by how fast Skype is catching on. Based in Stockholm, the company is controlled by a privately held holding company called Skyper Limited. It has spent no money on marketing the software</p>
