[this post][1] has info about the new NVidia drivers for linux. they are available [here][2]. i have to try these. theres an other post [here][3] and the gentoo forums post, where i found the links is [here][4]. i like the XFree system which is accelerated. only thing is a lot of the apps i use arent accelerated though. played Unreal Tournament 2003 demo under linux @ 1024X768 with 24Bit color and it was very fast. under windows it had its problems. weather that was something to do with the [hard drive being really slow at the time][5] i dont know.
