Right. i though the other template i had before was too much like everyone elses, as it was a default one. since im a webmaster, or so i tell my self, i decided to attack the template and make my own. this is the begining of something new. So, ill update stuff later. I also added links to the RSS2 news feed, GeoURL (all at the side bar, no links here. lazy!) and i removed a few things slowing down the loading of the site. 2 javascripts. my blog roll and something else is gone. hmmmm. working on getting the blogroll back. twas good! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> Anyway, bed now. talk to you after.
