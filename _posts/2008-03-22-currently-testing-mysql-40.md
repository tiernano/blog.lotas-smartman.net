Right then. i have just gotten <a href=\"http://www.mysql.com/\">MySQL</a> 4.0 installed on my workstation and now the site is powered by this machine for the SQL queries. Its pretty cool. I have copied all data that was on the server over to the Workstation and now im watching as queries go though. i cant see the query its self, just the traffic being used, number of SQL queries being done, etc. its pretty sweet. So MySQL 4.0 will be installed on the server soon. no down time is expected. i like having multiple machines! [update] back using 3.23.58 on the server. cant figure out how to install 4.0 on the server yet. will work on it later. going to start backup of the workstation now, and format and reinstall soon.
