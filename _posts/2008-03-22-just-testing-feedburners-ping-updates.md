<a href=\"http://www.feedburner.com\">FeedBurner</a>, the site that are currently managing my RSS feed for this site, have released a cool thing: <a href=\"http://www.burningdoor.com/feedburner/archives/000478.html\">updating of your feed immediatly</a>. Bascily, every half hour feedburner downloads my RSS file, and then publishes it with some modifications. it also keeps an eye on stats and various other things. but, now they have the option that lets me ping them, telling them i have an update, and they then get my RSS file and post it immediatly! some modification had to be done to get <a href=\"http://www.wordpress.org\">WordPress</a> to work, so hopefully it does!!! this is the first post with the new feature. ill post if it doesent or does work&#8230; [update] not sure if it works. seems theres some network problem between me and feedburner. not too sure why. it has feeds up to 25th march. so its off by a day. hopefully it will be fixed soon.
