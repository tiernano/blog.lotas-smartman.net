I have been using winxp x64 edition for the last 24 hours or so, and its definatly impressive, but untill i get some 64 bit drivers for sound, wifi and the rest (my new Belkin Bluetooth PCMCIA card dont work, neither does the build in card readers) i think i may go back to 32bit mode, or at least particially. how long does it take for 64bit drivers to be built and tested? the betas of XP x64 have been out for a while now, and the RTM has been too, so whats the wait?!
