Ahhh crap. cound out that the [ESB][1], Irelands main Electrical supplier, will be on strike some time over the next while. outages start on monday, i think, still looking for info on news sites, and this will mean that i need external hosting by saturday/sunday. Actually found some info [here][2] and [here][3]. so now i need a web host with MySQL and PHP support. hmmmmm&#8230;.. so this is your advance warning!
