Yahoo now have a webservice and you can sign up and get 5000 Queries a day here at the [Yahoo&nbsp;Developer Network][1]. Oreilly.NET has a quick how to here on [how to use their results][2]. Pretty cool. Wonder when or if MSN will get one of these. I know you can get search results as an [RSS feed][3], but i wonder if there will be an API or web service for developers&#8230;
