A while back, before [i got my hands on my new MacBook Pro][1], i went on a bit of [a rant about dual external monitors for laptops][2]&#8230; this, i must admit, was a crazy idea. why, in reality, would most people want 2 external monitors on their laptops&#8230; well, photography, programming, or anything where multiple monitors come in handy would be very good reasons&#8230;

anyway, the reason for this post is around using external monitors with my current MacBook pro, using either a mini displayport to DVI adapter, or a mini display port to VGA adapter&#8230;

i have this currently setup in work and at home. all i need to do is plug in power, the monitor, and thats pretty much it. i use the keyboard and monitor of the &#8216;book, but might change that some day&#8230;

anyway, i found the best way to have the monitor set up is in Portrait mode&#8230; 90 Deg turn. both the monitors i have in work and the monitors at home do this, and very well&#8230; here, for example, is a photo of the setup at home: 

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3115/3174304043_f8aa62ab3e.jpg" alt="100_0824" border="0" width="282" height="500" />
</div>

</a>

the photo aint great. it was taken on my mini digital camera, but it shows what you need to see. i have my main work window open on the laptop its self ([Entourage][3] for email, [Microsoft Messenge][4]r for IM, etc) and Safari or FireFox open on the second email for surfing. it works well, and having the screen in that orientation is very handy. you can read so much more! the only problem i have is space&#8230; ideally, i would like the MacBook Pro at one side, with a keyboard and mouse plugged into it and a nice 19 or 20&#8243; wide screen display, but also, beside that, have the current 2 dell 20&#8243; monitors and the Mac Pro, with its keyboard and mouse&#8230; this way i am surrounded by monitors&#8230; would be nice!
