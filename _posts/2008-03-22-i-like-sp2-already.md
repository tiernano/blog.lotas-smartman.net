    I&rsquo;m linking Windows XP SP2 a lot already. It&rsquo;s pretty sweet. When you try run an app, it tells you if it&rsquo;s secure (signed) or not. &nbsp;Actually, not sure about signed apps. I think they just run. Pretty sweet. Installed it last night and it got some extra updates. It won&rsquo;t talk to Norton Antivirus 2003 though. It might talk to 2004, but 2003 wont tell it anything. Anyway, it&rsquo;s pretty cool. So far so good.
