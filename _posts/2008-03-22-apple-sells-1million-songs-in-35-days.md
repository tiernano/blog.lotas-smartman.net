[this apple press release][1] states that apple has sold 1 million songs in 3.5 days since the release of [iTunes][2] for windows. users have also downloaded iTunes a total of 1 million times too. this is not bad for a 3 and a half day old application. well i know its a bit older, but for the platform its new.
