[Ireland to build register of 3G phone users | The Register][1]. stupid question but how can that stop someone? Like think about it. if a phone supports MMS, 90% of the time it also supports email. If you can email on it, you can probably set your own mail settings. Im using my nokia with 3 different email servers and one of them (my home email account) is private and i have the info for it. who monitors what i send via that? Also with the advant of 3G phones with more processing power in your pocket then a 486 or even pentium processor (the chip in my phone is a 100Mhz MIPS) and the ability to write software for phones being made even easer (J2EE, .NET, Symbian all being fairly easy to program for) whats stopping someone creating a program that will encrypt what ever your sending via email and on the other end decrypt it, be it computer or phone? and there blocking web site address that are blacklisted! This could be one of those ploys for you to use their services and not someone elses. I download my ring tones off free wap sites insted of paying vodafone ireland EUR2+ for them. i also get my games free from different sites insted of paying EUR6 for them, and who is to say they wont be blocking them? This is not looking good. I might be becomming my own ISP for my mobile soon&#8230;
