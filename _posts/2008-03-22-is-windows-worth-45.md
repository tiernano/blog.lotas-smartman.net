[Theres an article over here on the Wall Street Journal][1] asking is windows worth $45. it sayts that for what you pay for the average PC, $45 goes to Microsoft for Windows. They ask is Windows worth it. Well, Why not? Ok, i know you can get all the antitrust thing you want, but when you look at what you get for your $45, which, BTW, is an guestimate by them, its not that bad. theres Windows Media Player, which, ok is free, but has CDR support. DVDR support is built in, a firewall, [antivirus is in SP2][2] (i think), and various other cool things. you have Windows Movie Maker, which isent great, but does the job, and you get all this for the same price as [Nero][3]. Actually, Nero cost more. So, by my reckoning, windows should be worth more then $45. its better then going to the shop and paying EUR163 just for XP Pro, or EUR101 for Windows XP home, as an OEM copy.
