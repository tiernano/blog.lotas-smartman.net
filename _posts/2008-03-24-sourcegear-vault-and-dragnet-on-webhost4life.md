I have been looking more and more into a Source Control system for home, and  
i was thinking of getting a dedicated box in house for this. the problem is  
bandwidth (if using externally) and backing up (i dont do a lot&#8230;). Well, one  
of the Source Control Systems i found is an app called [SourceGear][1] [Vault][2], and a  
second&nbsp;tool called [Dragnet][3], which is a bug  
tracking tool.

The cool thing about the 2 of these is that 1) they are completly written in  
.NET, and 2) they are free for 1 developer, like me! ([see pricing info here][4],  
and the the [FAQ  
here][5]) Sweet! So, next was hosting, and i found this article (actually couple  
of articles) [showing you how to get both  
Vault and Dragnet][6] to work with [WebHost4Life][7]. Very cool stuff!

So, now all i need is the time to set the system up and play around&#8230;.  
hmmmm
