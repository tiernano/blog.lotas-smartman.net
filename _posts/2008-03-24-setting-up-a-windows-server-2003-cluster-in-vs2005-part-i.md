[Setting Up A Windows Server 2003 Cluster in VS2005 &#8211; Part I][1] and [part 2][2]. Interesting read. i have the most of the hardware to set one of these up at home (Duron 700 with 384mb ram, Athlon 1.3Gz with 512mb ram and my dual athlon 2Gz with 512mb ram) but i dont have a shared storage setup yet. now to find a good one of them for testing! its better to use real machines then virtual ones, right?!
