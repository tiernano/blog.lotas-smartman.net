<a href=\"http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=15017\">the inquirer is reprting on 100Mb/s DSL</a> over a standard phone line! Now thats fast. that works out at about 12.5mbytes per second! my internal lan wouldent support that speed! imagine 2 of them and a twin wan router. you would max out the router (probably melting it!) and also my 100mb/s netowork. wish Eircom would run this around ireland. Wishfull thinking!
