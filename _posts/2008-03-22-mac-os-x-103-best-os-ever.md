[this Australian IT article][1] states that [Mac os x 10.3][2], or Panther, is the &#8220;Greatest OS Ever invented&#8221;. Also, [This EWeek article][3] talks about how its great for developers because of [XCode][4]. Cant wait till i get my extra memory, hopefully with in the next week or two, and get a copy of panter or jaguar. quite broke so i might get jaguar first, then panter. see if some one has it second hand cheap!
