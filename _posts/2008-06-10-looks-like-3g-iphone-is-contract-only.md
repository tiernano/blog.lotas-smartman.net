Looks like my worst fears for the new 3G iPhone are comming true&#8230; It will be contract only, with no activation at home&#8230; SiliconReplublic.com are reporting that [O2 are doing new pricing for the iPhone][1], all based on contracts. quoting their site:

*<font color="#333333" size="2" face="Verdana">The 8GB iPhone 3G will cost &euro;49 on the &euro;100 monthly iPhone tariff, &euro;99 on the &euro;65 tariff and &euro;169 on the &euro;45 tariff.</p> 

<p>
  The 16GB iPhone 3G will cost &euro;129 on the &euro;100 monthly tariff option, &euro;169 on the &euro;65 tariff and &euro;299 on the &euro;45 tariff. </font><br /> </em>
</p>

  thats looking bad. they wont sell you an iPhone for EUR49 assuming your going to&nbsp;pick the EUR100&nbsp;a month contract when you get home. they want proof, and the best proof is in store&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> mind you, i did see some interesting news on the UK O2 Store: <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk/iphone/paygo">PrePay iPhone comming soon</a>! no contract signing. i like that.
