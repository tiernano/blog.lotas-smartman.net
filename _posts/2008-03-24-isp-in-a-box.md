Nerd Vitals have 3 articles currently, and more i think on how to turn your  
mac mini into an ISP in a box. In [part 1 they show you how to set  
up&nbsp;Apache][1], etc. [Part 2  
shows you how to setup mail servers][2], etc. final one on the site at the  
moment is [how to setup MySQL][3].  
Very interesting read. check it out. if its any consilation, i have an ISP in,  
well, 3 machines&#8230; do i win? <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
