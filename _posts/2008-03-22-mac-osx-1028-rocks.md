i have been using mac osx 10.2.8 for the last couple of hours and Oh my gods does it rock! im using a standard creative labs opticle mouse with 2 buttons and a wheel and it sees it and the wheel works and so does the right mouse button properly! so the mac isent just limited to a single button! iTunes also rocks. i have it on my workstation and the mac and the workstation is sharing all its mp3s with the mac. this is pretty handy since there was only one check box to select (in the options, set sharing as on). they found each other with some [magic][1]. all in all, im quite happy! now for the upgrade to 10.3, which will be after christmas, but i still cant wait! **I Believe In A Thing Called Lo** from the album &#8220;Permission To Land&#8221; by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22The Darkness%22" target="_blank">The Darkness</a>
