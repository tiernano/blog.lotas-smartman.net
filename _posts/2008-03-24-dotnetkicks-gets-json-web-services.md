Gavin over at DotNetKicks has just added [JSON Services to the DotNetKicks site][1]. This is very cool. You can get the most popular stories and upcoming stories at the moment, but hopefully there will be more. Ideally, i would like to see the ability to Kick a story using JSON. this way someone could build a client for the desk or mobile&nbsp;and everything could be supported. Also, Gavin, if your listening (or reading) how about support for finding stories by tags, listing tags, and stories kicked by users? Probably already on your plate, but in case they aint! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
