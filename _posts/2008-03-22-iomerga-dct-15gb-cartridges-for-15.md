[this article over at pocketpc thoughs][1] talks about DCT cartgidges. Like like iomerga CLick or pocket Zip. the thing thats really interesting is their reported at, etc this, $15 each! now, i know you would have to buy hardware, but thats cheap. a 100Mb zip disk is about that price and the 250 is a little more expencive. but the thing thats even more interesting is the fact that its about 2 inches wide! look at the link for a pic! that would be sweet for a palm top. 1.5Gb for anything! Sweet! i cant wait till it comes out. next summer they say. sweet.
