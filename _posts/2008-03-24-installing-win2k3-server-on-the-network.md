I have just started studying for MCP exam [70-290: Managing and Maintaining a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Environment][1]. I got the [MCSE Self Paced Training Kit: Windows Server 2003 Core Requirements][2], which is quite a large book. actually its 4 books. so, im studying the first exam, and im setting it up on my network. there will be no disruption to the web site, but email is going to be handled by Exchange 2000. More on that later.
