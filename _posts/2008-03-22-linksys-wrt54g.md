[LinksysWrt54g &#8211; SeattleWireless][1]. interesting wiki page. LOTS, and i mean LOTS, of information about this wireless router. Im looking at a wireless network for my house and im looking at this one because its the most hackable (since it runs linux) and its a pretty damn cool looking device too. i only have one question. Can this be run with an exsisting network? Im thinking of getting the ISA box running as the main router on the network, and if thats done, then the [Linksys WRT54G][2] router will not be needed as a router, but more as an access point/switch. More research needed on that one!
