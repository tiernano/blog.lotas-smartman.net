I was just printing something out (directions, a map, and the open/closed times of a nearby bike shop) from a web page when it dawned on me that a really cool app would be a printer driver that sends whatever it is you&#8217;re printing to your phone. Maybe even as an SVG document, so you could zoom, etc., or if not, just as a decent resolution JPG so you could view all the data without problems.

The computer could send the file to the phone via Bluetooth, or maybe just &#8220;auto-post&#8221; the data to a website somewhere to be retreived later when you need it. That&#8217;d be \*really\* useful, no?

Cool.

[[Russell Beattie Notebook][1]] i just read this idea and its a good one. so good i have tried it. not yet on my [7650][2] but on my [clie][3]. im using the mac to print my files as PDF files, send them to the clie using [Adobe&#8217;s actobat for the Palm][4] and away i go! russell was right in his [second post on this matter][5] about the macs having support to print to PDF (well it may be 10.3 only). im going to try this [PDF+][6] for my phone and see if it works well too. good idea none the less!
