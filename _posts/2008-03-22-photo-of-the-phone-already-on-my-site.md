[check out this photo back in march][1]. I was up in Neury and they have an Orange shop up there. Orange took the iMate Smartphone 2 and modified it and made it an orange branded SPV E200. this is what im getting, except without the orange branding! Its funny what you find on your own site when your looking for other things! I was just checking to see how long it took for the [palm bluetooth adapter i ordered][2] back in march to arrive. i got my phone from the same place. anyway, i think ill start posting more photos to [my photos][3] site soon&#8230;
