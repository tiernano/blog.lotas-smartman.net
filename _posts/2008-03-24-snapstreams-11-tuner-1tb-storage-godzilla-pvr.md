Snapstream have done it again! First, they came out with a [6 Tuner Medusa PVR][1], then the [10 Tuner Hydra][2], and now, they have an [11 Tuner GodZilla PVR][3]! This comes with 7 Standard Def Tuners and 4 High Def Tuners, 1Tb of storage for recorded content and 2 160Gb hdds for Apps and OS. its definatly an impressive machine. Now if only&nbsp;Windows Media Center Edition could talk to so many cards&#8230;. <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
