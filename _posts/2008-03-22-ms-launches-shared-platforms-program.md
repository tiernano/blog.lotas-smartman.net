From [OSnews][1]Microsoft Launches &#8220;Shared Platforms&#8221; Program By Eugenia Loli-Queru, submitted by Anonymous &#8211; Posted on 2003-06-02 21:41:57 According to [a news item at WindowsForEmbedded.com][2], Microsoft has launched a new program in its &#8216;shared source&#8217; initiative. This one enables the sharing of &#8216;platforms&#8217;, allowing, for example, hobbyists &#8216;to convert an old PC into any number of Windows CE .NET-based devices, such as a digital audio receiver,&#8217; using files downloaded from a community repository. Free and time-fused tools are available for download from Microsoft&#8217;s website to facilitate the process.
