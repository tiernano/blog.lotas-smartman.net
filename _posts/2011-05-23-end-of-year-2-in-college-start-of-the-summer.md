So, the second year of college is just about over&#8230; Got my final exam on Networking in about 2 hours and then I am hopefully finished till about September or October&#8230;. I say hopefully, thats assuming I don&#8217;t need to repeat an exam&#8230;. So, now that I got the evenings free, I have a few projects I have been waning to build and release&#8230;. I am hoping to start on these in the next few weeks and see how things go&#8230;. I have a load of domains registered for different projects, and I hope to start releasing stuff for testing soon&#8230; If you are interested, drop me a mail (tiernan at tiernanotoole dot ie) and we can chat&#8230;.
