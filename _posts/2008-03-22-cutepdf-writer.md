<a href=\"http://www.cutepdf.com/Products/CutePDF/writer.asp\">CutePDF Writer</a> is a cool, free little app that makes a virtual printer on your machine and allows you to print anything printable into a PDF file. this is cool. First seen something like this on a Linux Box using Netscape 4.7 (could have been in other 4.X releases) that printed anythign to PS file and then allowed you to convert that to PDF using Ghostscript. this does pretty much the same. The mac has had it since OSX10.3, so im happy now with this. I have Adobe Acrobat reader for my PDA, so i can now print to PDA! SWEET!
