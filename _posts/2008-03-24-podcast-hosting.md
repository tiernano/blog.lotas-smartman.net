I have a [.mac][1] account which i am currently using to host my podcasts, but that dies early next year and its got no FTP access that i can find. so, i just searched MSN search for PodCast hosting and found [this place][2]. $5 a month for 100mb of storage and un-meatered bandwidth! pretty cool i though. i may used them eventually&#8230;
