Forget the [iTunes phone][1] (which is just rediculous!) , this is what you want! the new [Samsung i300][2]! i posted about it [here before][3]. its got a 3Gb hdd, and run windows mobile. Very nice looking phone. now we have pricing info though, but im pretty sure the original article i read had pricing info too&#8230; I want one of these, just for the 3Gb hdd, and the windows mobile (not that i need a new phone or anything&#8230;)
