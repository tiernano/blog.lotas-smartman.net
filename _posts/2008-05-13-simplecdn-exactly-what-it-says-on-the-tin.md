NOTHING! well, except the upload in the first place&#8230;

the [Pricing page][3] shows how much you pay for different file sizes. for example, files upto 1mb will cost you 1 credit ($1). 1-5mb costs 2 credits. and it goes up. 20gb will cost you only 335 credits!

So, some maths here. Say, i get back into podcasting (which i would like to do, eventually) and i do both a Video cast and MP3 cast. the MP3 would weigh in at, say, 15mb, and the video would be about 50 &#8211; 75mb. it would cost me 5 credits to upload the MP3 and 9 credits to upload the Video. but that would be it. no more charges. with S3 (as an example), i would pay a reoccuring charge of about a cent a month to host both (mp3 would cost $0.002 and the video would cost about $0.007, but amazon round up, so we say a $0.01). for each download i would be charged $0.002 per mp3 and $0.008 per video. doesent sound like a lot, right? Ok, but if i get 100 downloads of that , that works out at $0.80 for the video and $0.20 for the mp3. if the file has a "long tail" of 1 &#8211; 5 downloads a month, thats another 1 &#8211; 4c per month. hosting for the year would cost between 2 and 9c.

again, doesent sound like a lot, but after a year, this place would pay for itself. especially if your working with files over 75mb! 100 downloads of a 75mb file would cost you $1.27, 6c per month reoccuring for 5 downloads and another cent or so a month for hosting.

If you sign up, they even give you 15 credits to play with! signed up already, and i will be playing with this over the next while.
