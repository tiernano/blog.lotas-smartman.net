I like the sounds on NANT. the idea of simple building of a project, with custom tasks and the ability to package and deploy the app is very cool. add unit testing to the mix, and your very sorted. So, while looking up some info, i came across [Oren Ellenbogen&#8217;s blog post on the subject][1] where he walks though how he setup NANT for his ASP.NET project. his project is not much different to mine either: Web Front End, BLL, DAL and Entities layer. the only difference is i have a Web Services layer in the back, and also have a testing project too. Anyway, something i will be playing with soon!
