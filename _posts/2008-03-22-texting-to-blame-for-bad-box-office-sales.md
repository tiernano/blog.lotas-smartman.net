Right. [this slashdot article][1] says that the movie industry is [blaming][2] text messaging for filims doing badly in movies. they say its not becasue the films is a heap of crap, but because people are telling their friends thats its crap. Well strange that. not only do i tell my mates if a film is crap over TXT, but over voice too. so will texting and talking be banned by the MPAA? what about blogging or movie reviews? email? anything for that matter?
