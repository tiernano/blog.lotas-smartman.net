Cool! Looks like we have a new Distributed In Memory Caching platform for .NET, [code named "Velocity"][1]. This is very cool! the [CTP is available to download here][2]&nbsp;and dont forget to read the documentation (available&nbsp;on the download&nbsp;site). the [MSDN site is available here][3], and there is an [overview article here][4]. i am very much wanting to play around with this!
