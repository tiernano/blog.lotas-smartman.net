Right. i got linux back on my system in the early hours of this morning. when it installed, the first thing i did was try get mail. my server is acting as a mail server at the moment, and i was using an imap client to read the mail. so, there was about 5500 emails sitting on the server when i started. so i used [fetchmail][1] to get all my mail and it is still scanning for spam! it started this morning about 3 am! and the machine im using is the dual processor athlon! this is complete madness. there must be a quicker way of doing this. going to find out now&#8230;
