I just found Flock. this is one very interesting web browser. there are more built in features than i can count, and it has a built in blogging tool, which i am currently using to post this&#8230;

Still playing around with it, but there are some very nice features&#8230; I do like the web clip board feature, allowing you to take notes by dragging them into the side bar. they can then be used in your blog posts if you want later on. Very cool stuff! And its powered by Mozilla, so the rendering engine is quite cool too&#8230; check it out if your into that sort of thing
