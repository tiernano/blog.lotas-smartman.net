There are rumors going around ([like this one  
over at Ars Technica&#8217;s Infinate Loop][1]) saying that a 17&#8243; [Mac Book Pro][2] could be on the cards as  
early as Sunday. Its an interesting idea, and if true, i will be thinking about  
one of those insted of the 15&#8243; model. I like having a large screen with me,  
hence the reason i bought the [17&#8243; HP  
laptop][3], but thats slightly bulkier then the current [17&#8243; PowerBook][4]. All will  
be announced soon, hopefully&#8230;
