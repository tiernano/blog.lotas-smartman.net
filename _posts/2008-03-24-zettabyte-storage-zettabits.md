I found this yesterday, but dident get a chance to post about it. Its called [Zettabits][1]. Its a Service/Hardware combo which allows for easy remote backup. The idea is fairly simple. You have a box sitting on your network (think NAS device) with some storage. Everytime something hits it, it automagically copies it to a remote storage site ([Amazon S3][2]). If something goes badly wrong, you can recover your files via S3. pricing is interesting:&nbsp;$49 a month for 30GiB storage and goes to $299 for upto 690GiB a month. There is also the [profesional version][3], which is a bit more expencive, but has RAID support. Interesting stuff. Now if only i could build one my self&#8230;. <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> [[via engaget][4]]
