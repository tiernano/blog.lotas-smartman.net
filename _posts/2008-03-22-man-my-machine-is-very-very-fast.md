i know i keep going on about it, but man this thing rocks. im in work now and i brought me a copy of [Distributed.net][1] for testing the benchmarks. but as i mentioned last night, my mahcine is capable of doing something like 12million keys a second. this thing in here (P4 1.6Gz, 256mb ram, win2k) is doing a max of 2.2million keys a second! Waheay! 6X Faster. its only 2.5X Faster in CPU speed, 3X faster in rating speed (1600 here, 4800+ (2400+*2) at home) and 2X in memory speed (home = DDR266, here=PC133, i think, could be 100Mhz). Anyway, you never know how fast a machine is till you bech others! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
