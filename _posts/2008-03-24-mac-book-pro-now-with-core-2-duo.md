Apple has just updated their [Mac Book Pro][1] line. Now they have either a 2.13Gz or 2.3Gz Core 2 Duos. now upto 39% faster. one interesting thing i found in the [tech specs][2]: the <strike>15 inch has a single DIMM slot</strike>&nbsp;the 2.16Gz has 1 Dimm slot, and the 2.3Gz has 2 dimm slots.&nbsp;both the 2.3Gz 15&#8243; and 17&#8243; comes with 2, for up to 3Gb ram. Which is strange. Why cant i get 2 2Gb dimms in there? Also, these are 64 bit, arent they? [update] the 17&#8243; comes with 2Gb ram standard! SWEET!
