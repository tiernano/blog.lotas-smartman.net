Well, yesterday, after a very long abense, i [said i was planning to move this site to 
Jekyll][1] and after many years of thinking about it, it has finally happened. If your 
reading this, its been done... I will post more about [Jekyll][2], how i moved, etc, 
soon. 

As for now, the site should still have all the same stuff the old one did, and shout 
be a LOT faster, given there is no HTML generation done when you hit the page. Also, 
with the help of [Rackspace][3] and [Akamai][4] this site should fly since its hosted 
beind their CDN product. Next is to move the [photography blog][5] and the 
[podcast][6], though the podcast will probably be retired sooner 
rather than later...
