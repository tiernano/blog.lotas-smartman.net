OreillyNet has [this article showing you how to develop for the XP media center 2005][1]. Very cool. maybe an app that connected to different RSS feeds ([channel 9][2] or [Adam Curry][3] for example) and found all the media in the file, listed it as available to you with basic info, and allow you to watch or listen to said media. kind of like podcasting or videocasting for your TV (or big monitor). interesting ideas&#8230;..
