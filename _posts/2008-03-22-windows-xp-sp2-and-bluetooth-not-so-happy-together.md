[Windows XP SP2 and Bluetooth &#8211; Not So Happy Together?][1] Hmmm. strange that. i installed my bluetooth adapter and the drivers that [MSI][2] gave me when i got the bluetooth adapter, and windows never installed its own bluetooth stack or drivers. mind you, when i installed the bluetooth adapter it asked did i want to restart my machine. i said no and that now probably about 10 days ago! i should probably reboot and it should work. theres a load of photos on my 7650 that i need to upload to the PC and web and i want it talking to my PDA too. i hope i can get the networking part working!
