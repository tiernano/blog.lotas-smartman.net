[microsoft have released a list of fixes and changes to windows XP SP2][1]. this is due out in a while, and ill probably be running linux by then, but looking forward to this anyway. if it makes my machine harder to get malware in, which it looks like it might, ill be happy and installing it on my sisters machine. now for more memory for her computer&#8230;..
