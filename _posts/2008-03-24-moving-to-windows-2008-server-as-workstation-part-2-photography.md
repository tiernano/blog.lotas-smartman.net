<a href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/archive/2008/03/21/moving-to-windows-2008-server-as-workstation-part-1.aspx" mce_href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/archive/2008/03/21/moving-to-windows-2008-server-as-workstation-part-1.aspx">In part 1</a>, I said I hoped most of my apps (expect for Media Sharing and Live Writer) would work in Windows Server 2008. Well, my next test is Photography software, and the big one for me is Photoshop LightRoom. And, well, it works! No problems. I haven&#8217;t done much with it, other than load it up, but it installed and runs. You may be asking what about Photoshop its self? Currently downloading the trial and will get back to you on that one&#8230;

u[date] Photoshop CS3 and Adobe Bridge both seem to work correctly. Bridge complains at the start saying it requires XP with SP2 or above.. Other than that, its all working grand.
