[ZDNet has a nice article][1] on whats happened in kernel 2.6.0. there is support for up to 32 processors and better access to the hard drive and others. but theres now a practical limit of 24GB of ram, insted of 2.4&#8217;s 32Gb. i dont think ill have to worry about that for some time now though! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
