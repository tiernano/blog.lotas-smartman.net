I linked to this in my last post [here][1], but i dident realize how cool it actually is till it finished scanning my hard drive. [WinDirStat][2] is a windows app that searches though your hard drive for all the files, directories, etc and gives you a nice graph showing you all your files in graphical format. very cool.
