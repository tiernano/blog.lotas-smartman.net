I am working on an web site, which, due to a small setback with SVN servers, I have put on hold for a day or 2, but will hopefully get released (or BETA released anyway) soon. One of the features I want to add is SMS support, to allow users to send text messages to the service. [BT21C has support for this][1], but the [cost][2] (see down the bottom) is a bit high for testing, etc. dedicated number is £100 setup, and £25 a month for most of Europe support. or £75&nbsp;a month for most of world, EXCEPT US. Or, there is keyword rental, which cost £10 a month for most of Europe, or £20 for Most of world, Except US. [Direct SMS][3] has a similar setup, but looks like Australia only&#8230;[Clickatell][4] also offer inbound messaging, but its a [bit confusing][5] how its done&#8230; (standard number cost EUR100 to setup, but is it EUR75 or 25 for monthly fee?).

Anyway, after reading a bit about this, I cant find anything &#8220;cheap&#8221;. I was hoping that Vodafone&#8217;s BetaVine may have something, but by the looks of things, there is no inbound SMS. So I have been thinking about other options:

  * [Twitter][6]: there are some inbound SMS options that work with Twitter. For example, in the US, if you send &#8220;d tiernano testing&#8221; to 40404,&nbsp;I will get a direct message (you have to have a twitter account, and the [mobile service enabled][7]). theory behind that is that there are twitter clients all over the place, including for phones, which would mean anyone with a twitter account could send a message, and not cost them much (or nothing in some cases). 
  * Some sort of Modem: is it possible to buy a modem that plugs into a server, which has a SIM in it, that would run a command when a text message comes in? what about an API for that device? that would rock!

Anyone out there in Internet land know what I can do?</p>
