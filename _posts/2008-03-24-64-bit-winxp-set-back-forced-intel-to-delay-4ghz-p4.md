[64-bit WinXP set-back forced Intel to delay 4GHz P4? | The Register][1]. the 4Gz P4 will be a 64ET system. The Register are asking is it Microsoft to blame for this, but then says that the first 64bit P4s will be out next week. now, the logic behind blaming Microsoft for the delay of the 64 bit P4 is just weird since its technically out next week. also comming out next week is a Dual Processor 64 bit enabled Xeon. looks like 2004/2005 is the year(s) of the 64bit chips!
