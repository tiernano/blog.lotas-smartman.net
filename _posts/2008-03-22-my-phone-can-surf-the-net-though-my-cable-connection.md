IThis is mad. i found out how to get my phone to connect to the internet though my PC and my cable modem. basicly, you set up an access point with a name you call it, i called it &#8220;Bluetooth&#8221; and nothing else. set it as GPRS. then open something that needs an internet connection. when it opens, it will ask you for a connection. tell it to use &#8220;bluetooth&#8221; or what ever you named it and it works! make sure your phone is talking to your PC properly. i have the nokia PC suite for the 7650 installed and i tell the mrouter to connect to my phone though a virtual com post over bluetooth. this is com4 for my machine and phone. pretty cool anyway.
