and it doesent work out of the box, or off the server, or what ever. <a href=\"http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=6516\">OSNews is reporting that it was released</a>, and someone posted afterwards saying that after 4 hours of downloading, the first cd wont boot! this is still beta, but that should be something thats tested before they send it out. 4cds though. i have beta 1 of this at home and its on my parents machine (they like the games, i want windows on it cause my dad is learning Office and stuff, and Openoffice on a P2 266 with 192mb ram is not exactly fast, but MS Office 2000 on my sisters P2 266 with 128mb ram running windows 98SE is quite usable). wonder will they be getting this or windows 2k&#8230;.
