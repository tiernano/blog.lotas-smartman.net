[the distcc howto for gentoo linux][1] has some pretty interesting things in it that i missed the first time i read it. i wasent paying full attention cause i was no where near actually using it yet. put they have some extra tools. first is the monitors. theres a text based one, which they say isent the easyest to read, but they have one for gnome, which is really nice looking! [theres a screen shot here, just under step 4][2]. not only that, but there is a perl script called [distcc-subnetscan.pl][3] which scans your subnet for machines that run distcc. this is like what apple have in [xCode][4]. now, the one thing im looking for is a distributed java compiler. it would be a nice extra.
