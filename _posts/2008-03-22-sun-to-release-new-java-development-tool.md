<a href=\"http://news.com.com/2100-1012\_3-5181438.html?tag=nefd\_top\">news.com are reporting that Sun are to offer developers</a> a test copy (probably beta) of Java Studio Creator early next month (April 8 ). Its desigined as a Visual Baisc for Java. the last copy of a Java IDE that i had that was aimed as a VB for Java was <a href=\"http://www.borland.com/jbuilder/\">Borland\&#8217;s JBuilder</a>. it was nice, but it was no VB! it was slow, even on my dual athlon. and dont even try that with less then a gig of ram! anyway, we will see what this is like.
