microsoft are working on a new search engine to attack google according to [this article][1] on CNN. now, im one way this could be good, meaning they have more money to though at a project of this size easly. the only thing is they may have bigger more intrusive ads on their site then google (adwords never hurt a sole, pop-ups are evil) and they may start blocking linux/mozilla/anything non microsoft from entering their site, like they did with MSN a while back on opera. id like to see how this pans out.
