apple has released an update to [Boot Camp, Version 1.1][1]. This is still beta, but it now supports the new Intel Macs (Mac Pro, probably), has iSight drivers, built in Mic drivers, and more. you can now install Windows on any of the internal drives on your mac, but can windows see all the drives now?
