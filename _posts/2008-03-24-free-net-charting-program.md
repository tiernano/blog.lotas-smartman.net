Well, not totally free, but free for testing and development. check out [.NET Charting][1]. they are offering a free developer edition of their software which can be used for development reasons, but if you want to use it in a real app or a released app, you must buy a license. pretty cool looking. not totally sure what i could use charting for really, but i will find something so i can play with it! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
