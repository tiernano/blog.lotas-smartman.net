I am currently sitting in my new mobile office. Well, when i say new, i have had it for the last year and a half, but only now is it being extremly usefull. I am sitting in a 1996 BMW 523i, with my PowerBook, a Vodafone Mobile Broadband USB modem, and my Nokia 6234. The 6234 is paired with the cars bluetooth handsfree kit, and also with the PowerBook. I can make calls though the PowerBook using the OSX address book, and also send text messages the same way. i should also get notified of incomming phone calls. Only thing missing is notification and the ability to read incomming emails.&nbsp;

This is the true mobile office. Mac Mail is running connecting to my Gmail account, and also my .Mac account, and i have Entourage talking to my work Exchange Server. all traffic is being encrypted over the OpenVPN server, <a href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/archive/2008/01/11/openvpn-ubuntu-osx-windows.aspx" mce_href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/archive/2008/01/11/openvpn-ubuntu-osx-windows.aspx">i talked about yesterday</a>, and everything is working grand so far! This is very cool!&nbsp;

I cant really get a good photo, since i cant really standback and take photos&#8230; but this is a very nice place to be. One thing missing is a Windows Laptop (which would allow me to connect to my work network properly) and a power supply for the laptop.So, there you have it. the first post from my mobile office! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
