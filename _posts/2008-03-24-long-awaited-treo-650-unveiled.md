> The successor to the very popular Treo 600 has been revealed and features improvements all-round. It has a faster processor, high-res screen, Bluetooth, and even a megapixel camera, making it one of the most exciting smartphones yet to be released.

Looks interesting. BTW, if you have any problems with images not showing up on the site, please comment about it. i&#8217;m testing [Coral][2]&nbsp;and it some times works here and sometimes doesent. im behind a firewall and i hope thats all thats wrong.
