  * 3G and HSDPA internet on the go
  * A-GPS
  * and all the features of the old iPhone, plus Firmware 2.0 update.

will be released 11 July, and will cost $199 for the 8Gb black model, and $299 for either a 16Gb white or black model. 

one interesting thing though i found looking at the store&#8230; check out these 2 screen shots of the Requirements section from the Apple Store:

US Store:

![US Store][2]

Irish Store:

![Ireland Store][3]<img align="right" src="http://images.lotas-smartman.net/image.ashx?id=4a169d50-cfaf-4e6d-a4a8-729a65e796a6" alt />

As you can see, the US requires a 2 year contract with AT&T, but the Irish one says you need a Wireless Service, but doesent say who&#8230; does this mean its unlocked? Definatly one way of getting more customers buying them!

Next, [MobileMe][4]&#8230;. This is the replacment to [.Mac][5]. This is being touted as Exchange for everyone else&#8230; Push email, contacts and calander, and the rest that came with .Mac. Its an interesting service, and .Mac customers get upgraded for Free. It sells at the same price, $99. This comes with 20Gb storage (usually split between Email, web pages and online disk storage). Quite cool stuff. Due out Mid July (maybe 11 July, like the iPhone 3G)&#8230;.

Just one more thing&#8230; Wondering if 11 July will be the release day for the new Firmware? they said "July" but i cant off the top of my head find out if it was "mid" or "end of"&#8230; Mid would be the same general time frame as the iPhone 3G and MobileMe&#8230;. and we got pricing for it too&#8230; Firmware 2.0 will be free for existing iPhone users (as expected) and $9.99 for [iPod Touch][6] users&#8230;
