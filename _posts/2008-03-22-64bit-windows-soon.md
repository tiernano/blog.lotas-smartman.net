People forget very easily that there was a

</p> 

64bit copy of Windows NT4</a>. it was for the

Alpha</p> 

processor</a>, by [Digital][2], who where then

bought by [Compaq][3] who where bought by

[HP][4]. It was either [HP][4]

or [Compaq][3], or even

[Digital][2] for that matter, who sold something

of the Alpha</p> 

processor</a> to [Intel][5]. I think

[Compaq][3] up until last year, or so, still had

[Alpha powered][6]

[Compaq][3] systems. I know there was talk of the

killing the chip all together, but not sure if it went along with it. Pity. It

was a great chip. it ran at 533Mhz, when [Intel][5]&#8216;s

fastest was about 300Mhz. Look at them now. running at about 1.2Gz, or

completely stoped even, and [Intel][5]&#8216;s

fastest is about 3gz+.
