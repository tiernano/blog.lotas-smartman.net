Well, its been an interesting year. The year started with a party, and ends with another one (tonight). There has been some interesting things happen too. I finished working in Microsoft on [11Th March][1], and was back working for them on the [8Th August][2]! I got a [Guinness fridge][3] for my room, [a home cinema][4], [a new server][5], and many other wierd things. 2006 is currently only about 7 hours away at time of writing, and hopefully next year there will be more cool stuff to talk about. At the moment i am getting ready for said party, and i will hopefully start next year (sometime tomorrow afternoon&#8230;.) with a podcast. and now to get a video camera for video casts too! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Have a good one, and good luck!
