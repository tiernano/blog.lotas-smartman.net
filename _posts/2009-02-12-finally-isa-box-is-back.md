Right, it has taken a while (since my old ISA server died&#8230;. Minuites silence for the old scsibox&#8230;. please&#8230;.)

Anyway, the box [died about 2 Sundays ago][1] (waking me up in the middle of the night, mind you) and i have not been able to get it back online since&#8230; Well, i have just installed [Microsoft Forefront Threat Managment Gateway BETA][2], the next generation of ISA server, and this is what is serving this page to you now! It is all good! Its virtualized too, which means i am not running on some acient hardware that could die at any moment&#8230; i hope&#8230; So, we are back in business! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
