[this article][1] talks about a company who have build the worlds first pocket pc cluster! haha. cool!  


> It turns out that even a small cluster consisting of twelve nodes is still slower than a mainstream Pentium II-class desktop PC. However, the performance of Pocket PC devices is quite enough to deal with simple problems and their most important benefit is mobility. This makes Pocket PC platform very promising if used in distributed systems dealing with such problems as positioning and measurement.</p>
how cool would that be though?
