[Engadget has some &#8220;photos&#8221; of what looks to be a new device from Apple][1] (remember WWDC only a few days away). its called the &#8220;iChat Mobile&#8221; and they are asking is it a mobile phone. My guess is no. I think this could be a wifi enabled device, that will allow you to talk to your mac to make calls over iChat. Also, some of the weirder things: there looks like a camera on the back, which wouldent make a lot of sence, since ideally it should be on the front so you can see who your taking to (like most 3G phones) I dont know. We will see in a few days&#8230;
