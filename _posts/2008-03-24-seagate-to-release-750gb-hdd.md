Now this is sweet! check out this daily tech article with some (leaked) [details about a new Seagate  
hard drive weighing in at a stagering 750Gb][1]! that now means that with only 4  
Hdds you can hit the 3Tb mark, and with more (for arguments sake, lets just say  
using a single 8 port RAID Card) you could hit a max of 9Tb in a system (given  
you would not have a CDR Drive, and assuming you have 4 SATA ports on your  
system). Also, if, and this is only an IF, apple where to use this in the [XServe Raid][2], you would hit the  
stagering 10.5Tb total space. Hmmmmm. TeraBytes&#8230;. \*drool\*
