<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/articles/100730.aspx\">this article has some code samples and info</a> on how to get Meta data from WMA files. interesting idea. due to the fact that my mp3 player only plays mp3s, i rip most my songs in, you gues it, mp3 format. i would love a WMA player. i ripped one or two cds in WMA format and they sounded so much better then their MP3 equivalants. im still looking for an SMP enabled ripper and encoder! anyway, interesting article.
