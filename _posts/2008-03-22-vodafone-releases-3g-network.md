Well, data only so far, but its there. [Enn has some more info][1]. Still no news on price from vodafone, but enn are saying the card costs up to 288Euro, and data plans range from 25 to 199Euro! Man, thats expencive. only really big companies are going to go for stuff like that. i bet you the 25 euro includes something rediculous like 4 or 5mb of data for the month, and your charged something like .3c per k. you wouldent want to be doing anything usefull at them prices anyway! [update[ tipical! just as i posted that i found [the pricing and offer page][2]. for the 25 euro, which is vat exclusive, so add an other 21% to that, you get 20mb and are charged 1.45 per mb after that. and you have to pay 12.50 for sim rental on top of that too. but if you buy a bigger package, 100mb+, you get double download limit each month till january 2005. Still, slightly expencive&#8230;
