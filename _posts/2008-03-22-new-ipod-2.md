<a href=\"http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=393\">Apple Insider are reporting info on a new iPod</a> that will be released, they say, but no date info. It will be (if they are to be beleved) 50Gb, will have TV out for displaying photos, and a 2 inch color display for showing photos on the ipod too. 50gb will hold 12,500 songs. prices are around the $499 mark, and it does sound pretty cool. wonder how long it will be before release&#8230;
