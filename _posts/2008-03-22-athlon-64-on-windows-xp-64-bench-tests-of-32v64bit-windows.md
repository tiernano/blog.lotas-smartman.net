[Anandtech][1] has [some benchmark results][2] of windows XP 64 bit on a Athlon 64 versus the same CPU under 32bit windows xp. interesting results. up to 10% faster in some of the processor stuff, which, BTW, has not been optimized for 64 bit YET, and up to&nbsp;50% slower in gaming, probably down to drivers. its a good review. check it out.
