Right. i have a pain in the preverbial over my site getting attacked with this referal spam crap, so i am installing SQL Server 2000 tonight on one of my machines, running the .TEXT converter to convert my wordpress site into .TEXT and then starting it up. i will be working on writing a script that work out where you are ment to be going if you visit from a search engine and the page shows incorrectly. .TEXT has a fairly simular outline for its directories, so i will be using that. I will text you, but you will more then likly see it, when i have upgraded to .TEXT. more on that later&#8230;
