SCO has moved their domain name, and removed [www.sco.com][1] from DNS records. they are now at [www.thescogroup.com][2]. I read about it on [this Register article][3]. interesting part about it. it says that MessageLabs, as of luch time today (03/02/2004 or 3rd Feb 2004) had stoped 18Million Copies of the myDoom-A Virus (the one that attackes SCO) and only 100 Copies of the MyDoom-B Virus. I have a theory there. maybe techs who dont like SCO decided to run the virus on there systems, saying the where &#8220;accidently infected&#8221; but actually meaning to do so. i know i though of it, but decided agenst it since my interenet connection would be slow&#8230;
