At last! i got my server running though ISA 2004. just some small modifications needed. I had my publishing set up to say that traffic came from the user, not the ISA box. not sure why it dident work this way, but it might be something to do with my workstation (the web server) not using the ISA machine as a router. i have my Linksys acting as a router. So, what does this mean? I can start playing with IIS virtual servers and forward them to the internet. More on that later&#8230;
