[this article over at Popular Science explains how to unlock your phone.][1] I think most providers concider this illegal, but i dont know what will happen if you do this. i dont think they can do anything, but be careful. i got my 7650 unlocked from Vodafone, but i got it unlocked cause i had over 300EUR on my phone since i got it. like vodafone, a few mobile operators actually offer unlocking, either for a fee or free. A friend of mine has all the cables for unlocking most, if not all, nokias. theres also software, which is available [here][2] that can calculate an unlocking code for most nokias. handy.
