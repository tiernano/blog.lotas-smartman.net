So, last night i decided to get a new server. its a virtual dedicated server from [RackForce][1]. Its a [DDSHuricane][2] with 10Gb hard drive space and a 1.5mb/s link which is unmetered! there is nothing on it at the moment, other then one podcast which is [here][3]. i have put some stuff on it. more on that later.
