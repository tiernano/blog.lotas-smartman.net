Ok. I got hosting from a place called [DH2.net][1]. they are very cheap! i got 600mb webspace, 16gb transfer, 1 ip address, 16 mail address and a lot more for only $4 a month! i paid for a year in advance and now i own it! not a bad price. So, im going to use it for something, but not sure what yet. I will probably move certin thing over to it, like the blog, and leave them there till my internal network works 100%. anyway, more later&#8230;
