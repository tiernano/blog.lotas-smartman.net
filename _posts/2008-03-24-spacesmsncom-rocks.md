I have had a chance now to play with [Spaces.msn.com][1] and it is pretty cool. check out [my space][2]. It has some pretty cool features, like the posting of pictures quickly and easly. at the moment, if i want to post a photo to my blog, i have to upload it to an FTP site somewhere and then post a link to my blog. with spaces.msn.com, its all done in your browser. wonder will they have a programmable back end to it. that would be sweet. i also have to find out about using it as a moblog.
