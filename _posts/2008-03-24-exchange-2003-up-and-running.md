now to get ISA 2004 working. i just reinstalled Windows 2003 Server (Repaired actually) and it works. having a problem with ISA 2004 though. Something to do with MSDE i think&#8230; Hopefully i can fix this. its handy to have ISA since i only have 1 IP address, but i can have multiple servers with it!
