I have been playing with my GPS device i got a few days ago, and im now looking for some GPS software for it. I have been using Microsoft&#8217;s Pocket Streets and Trips, which works well, but i havent gotten it to give me directions to places (i have push pins in certin places that i know where thay are, but need proper directions, which it wont give..). i tried using the laptop today, but its too big, and i have to take my eyes a lot off the road to see it. it was sitting in my passanger seat, and the PDA was on the dash, so it was a lot easer to see. Anyone have a good tip on software for a PDA that will give directions and work in Ireland? Thanks.
