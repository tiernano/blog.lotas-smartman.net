Check out [ASPNETWebCasts.com][1]. Lots of web casts there over the next 2 weeks or so. i signed up for a load of these, but because they are running on US time, most dont start till 5PM and some dont finish till 12AM. Still lots of interesting web casts. and one really cool part (well cool for me with the PPC, smartphone, outlook on my laptop and an exchange server) is that you have the option to add a reminder with info in it to your outlook calander. so, now no matter where i am, i will get reminders of when one of these is about to start!
