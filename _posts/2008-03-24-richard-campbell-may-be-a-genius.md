And i dont think he will ever know. Well, maybe. I was reading the news, just after going to bed (dont ask&#8230;) and i&nbsp; found [this post by Richard about a failed water cooled machine][1]. one of the things that was mentioned was that the Motherboard light lighted up, but the system never came on. Well, a couple of weeks ago, my poor Opteron box had the same fate. And this got me thinking: is it the power supply dead in my machine too? Well, at the moment, i am not 100% sure, but, i do have a spare power supply. And you will never guess where i found it!

![cabinet at top of stairs][2]&nbsp;

Thats the cabinet at the top of the stairs. it seems a lot of random stuff ends up there. thats a DVD player and Video recorder on top of a very old Dell PC.&nbsp; and a lamp&#8230; I will try this out tomorrow. first, to find a screw driver&#8230; Ugh
