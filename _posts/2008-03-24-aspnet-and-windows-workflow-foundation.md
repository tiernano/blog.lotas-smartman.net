[Paschal&#8217;s blog][1] is definatly a handy resource! i cant figure out how i got unsubscribed from it&#8230; Anyway, Check out this article showing you [how to use ASP.NET and the Windows WorkFlow Foundation][2]. Again, handy for the photography site in that there is a workflow that should be completed once a photo is uploaded. [[Via Paschal][3]]
