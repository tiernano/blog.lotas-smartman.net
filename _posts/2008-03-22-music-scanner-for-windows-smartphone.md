[Check out this!][1]&nbsp;software for your Windows Smartphone that can tell you what your listening to. it records for 10 seconds, gets a checksum kind of thing, sends it to the company and you get a reply saying what the song is. handy. pity it only works on Windows smartphone. i want it to work on my 7650! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />
