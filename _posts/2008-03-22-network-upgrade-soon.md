About time! im moving my 450 from routing and proxy duties to become a server, and my P75 will be a router! hmmm. hope its up to the job. i had a 486 as a router before, but it wasent routing web traffic to a web server inside the network, just getting me access to the net. also it wasent connected to the net at 600k/s! it was only on a 56k dialup modem. Anyway, im going to town to get me some crimp ends for Cat5 net cable, and im going to then work on the new server tonight. The 450 is becomming a windows NT or 2k server, not sure. havent decided. ill post more when i know a bit more. hopefully it will be soon!
