[Neowin.net &#8211; Exclusive: WinHEC 2004 kicks off at Neowin &#8211; LH Build 4074][1]. interesting looking. looks like its gotten better since the last released build, the PDC one. anyway, looks good. new icons, new themes, and they say something about DCE too. Cant remember what DCE actually stands for at the moment, but its a DirectX accelerated desktop thing. best way i can describe it. sorry!!!
