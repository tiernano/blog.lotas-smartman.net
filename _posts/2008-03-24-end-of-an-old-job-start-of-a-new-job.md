Right. I have been working for the last 2 months in a place that im not going to tell you the name of, and i have been working on different things. its pretty cool, but about 2 days after i started here, i got an email saying i had a phone interview with another company. after the phone interview, i had 2 more full interviews, and finally about a month ago i got confirmation that i had the job. I will be telling you where i am starting on Monday, but untill then, if you already know, please dont comment. i want to make sure i can announce it, and need to change the layout of the site, add a disclamer, etc. but anyway, this is pretty cool stuff for me. this weekend is my &#8220;sit back and relax weekend&#8221; which might go slightly out the window if the RAM for the server arrived (rebuilding exchange servers is not my idea of relaxing, fun yes, relaxing, no!) or if i figure out how to get the other server i have back up and running (the original exchange sevrer). so, there will be relaxed posting over the next few days (and probably for part of next week) and i do hope to have a small podcast soon too. there is a few things i want to talk about soon, which i will over the next few hours, but untill then, i dont know&#8230;.
