[Verizon blessing us with cheap high bandwidth &#8211; Engadget &#8211; www.engadget.com][1]. And i though that EUR50 a month for 1.5Mb/s cable was cheap! Well, it is in ireland, but getting 10x that speed (site says for $50 a month you get 15mb/s down, 2mb/s up) for the same price is even cheaper! im moving to the US!
