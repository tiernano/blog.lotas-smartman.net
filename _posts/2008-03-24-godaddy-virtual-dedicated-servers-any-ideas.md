I am looking at [GoDaddy&#8217;s Virtual Dedicated Servers Options][1], and i need some info. Godaddy has helped with some questions, but i dont know yet. i needed to know if i can get more storage (by default their windows option comes with only 10Gb storage, and they say you can get more, but i cant find out where). they say i can install SQL if i own a license, which is handy, reboots are easy (i can submit a request for a hard reset, or via remote connection immediatly) and they are connected to the net at OC48 (which is a little faster then my 300K connection here&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> )Anyway, has anyone had experiance with this guys?
