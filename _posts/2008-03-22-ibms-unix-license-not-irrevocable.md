[this letter sent into the register][1] talks about the SCO V Linux, ibm, redhat and everyone else for that matter. As it states:  


> In fact, this very language comes from SGI&rsquo;s license it originally signed with AT&T which license SCO now owns:   
> If LICENSEE fails to fulfill one or more of its obligations under this Agreement, AT&T-IS (AT&T Information Systems) may, upon its election and in addition to any other rememdies that it may have, at any time terminate all the rights granted by it hereunder by not less than two(2) months&rsquo; written notice to LICENSEE specifying any such breach, unless within the period of such notice all breaches specified therein shall have been remedied; upon such termination LICENSEE shall immediately discontinue use of and return or destroy all copies of SOFTWARE PRODUCTS subject to this Agreement.</p> 
hmmmm. still. i think SCO has shot them selfs in the foot. hope they get it right the next time and aim for the head.
