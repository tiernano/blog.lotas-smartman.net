Right. i know im talking a lot about apple over the last few days, but im using [itunes][1] and always thinking! see, while surfing the iTunes store and i think that the browser thats powering it is [safari][2]. the reason i think its safari is simple: the way it looks. its not IE cause IE is pretty crap and doesent look as good as this and i doubt it its mozilla. apple use khttp for their browser and this is whats powering safari. i wouldent be suprised if the next big thing from apple for windows will be safari and i would be happy too! it looks cool.
