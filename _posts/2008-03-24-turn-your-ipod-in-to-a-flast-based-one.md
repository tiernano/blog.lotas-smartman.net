Check out this Proof of concept over at Geek Technique showing you [how to turn your iPod into a flash based one][1]. The model used in the demo is an iPod Mini (discontinued) and it works well. they take the Micro Drive out and stick in a 4Gb CF card. and, after retting the firmware and drive, it works. now, if you could get [SD to SSD Convertor][2] to take larger cards, and work with a 1.8&#8243; disc, you could replace the drive in a standard iPod. Interesting&#8230;.</p>
