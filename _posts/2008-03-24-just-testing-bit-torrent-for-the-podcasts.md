Ok. if you would like to help out a new podcaster in his distribution of his podcast, you could help me now! if you have bit torrent installed, click [this link for the podcast on 30 december 2004][1] or [this one for the podcast on 29 december 2004][2]. if this works well, i will be posting both links, but i would prefer if users downloaded the bit torrent one first. If you dont have bit torrent installed, get [Azureus from here][3]. Its a great peice of software and does a great job. i will be posting other things though bit torrent over the next while, because it saves on bandwidth. currently my uplink is limited to about 5k/s just for bit torrent. i will try get more over the next few days.
