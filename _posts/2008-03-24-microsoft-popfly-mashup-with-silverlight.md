Microsoft PopFly is a cool Silverlight based mashup site. I am not exactly sure what else to say about it other then it has a Duck as a logo! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

Its pretty cool, and allows for easy development of Mashups. I say development, its fairly straight forward. [Eric Griffin has some more info about it here][2]. Well, not only that, but there is an [SDK for developing the blocks][3] (again, thanks for Eric!). This is very cool!
