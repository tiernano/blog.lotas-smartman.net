after thinking about the network upgrade 2004 and posting [this][1] on saturday, i have changed one little thing. im now looking at a processor upgrade for the iMac. the info of the upgrade card is [here][2]. its a G4 466 for the imac, and you can upgrade your 233-333 imac with this. since its a G4, its a lot faster and more supported, and since its 466, its 133Mhz faster. its got 1mb cache, which is running @ 233Mhz. looks really cool. so, im looking at this and will decided soon. im hoping for the upgrade to start about the 2nd or 3rd week in january with the purchase of a hard drive for the imac. more info later.
