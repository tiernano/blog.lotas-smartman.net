Sorry for the kind of lack of posts. quite busy over the last while. working on some code at home though, which i will probably release to the web. im not going to say a lot about it, but basicly it takes in an email, looks for something in the email, and if its there, it sends it via text message (SMS) to someone. currently limited to Ireland Operators ([Vodafone][1], [Metor][2] and [o2][3]) but more might arrive later. watch this space!
