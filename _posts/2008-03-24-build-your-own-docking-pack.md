Check out this How to on [Building your own Docking Pack][1]. What’s a docking pack? Well, do you know all those docking stations you (and I) have for all your gadgets? The phone dock, the PDA Dock, the memory card reader, the other PDA dock, the connection for your MP3 Player (both Zen micro and iPod) and anything else? Take all of those, stick them in a laptop travel bag, add some power (or lots as the case may be) and a USB hub, and your good to go. Open, plug in your gadgets, and that’s it. When you need to run out the door, disconnect power and USB, close and bring with you! I have to try this!
