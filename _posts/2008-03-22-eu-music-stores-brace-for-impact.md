[Ars Technica are reporting][1] that OD2 are bracing for the impact of iTunes music store in Europe. this is going to happen today, [as i reported here][2], and Ireland are one of the places that can use the service! OD2 have set up a service where you can stream songs at 1c or 1p per song. they have been doing this for a while mind you. Also, all songs have been half priced for the next 2 weeks. cant wait though to play with iTunes. should be cool.
