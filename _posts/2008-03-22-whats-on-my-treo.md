so, i have had the treo for a few days now and its pretty cool, but what have I got on it, you may ask. well, there\&#8217;s a few things. firstly there\&#8217;s the Handspring Blazer Web browser, which so far is handy. used it to post some stuff here when i got it first. there is adobe acrobat for the Palm, which i use in conjunction with my mac to print out docs and send to my PDA (mac has built in save as PDF option). Next we have <a href=\"http://nikman.k2.net/today/\">Today</a> which is a little app that makes your palm look like the PocketPC Startup page. handy! next is <a href=\"http://www.astraware.com/games/popcap/bejeweled/?category=1\">Bejeweled</a>. This game is pretty sweet. The <a href=\"http://www.eudora.com/internetsuite/\">Eudora Internet Suite</a> is installed too. Email, web browser, what more could you want? <a href=\"http://standalone.com/palmos/hand_rss/\">Hand/RSS!</a> RSS news feeds on the move. having some problems with some feeds, but cool none the less! Vagablog is installed, but i told you that before, and so is <a href=\"http://www.palmone.com\">Palm</a> WAP and the bluetooth drivers for the palm bluetooth adapter. also got <a href=\"http://staff.deltatee.com/~angusa/TuSSH.html\">TuSSH</a> installed for managing the server. So far, most of the stuff on it is still DEMO, but i only got it friday, so ill wait before i buy!
