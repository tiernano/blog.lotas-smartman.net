[the Inquirer is reporting][1] that Linus has called SCO a &#8220;cornered rat&#8221;. 

> *&#8220;For some of the files they claim copyright ownership on I went back 12 years in the archives to see their original form, and the fact is, I was a young guy at university in &#8217;91, and I [made] mistakes that I simply wouldn&#8217;t [make] anymore, and that are clear signs of beginner [programming]. And those mistakes show how the code wasn&#8217;t copied,&#8221; he told the mag. 
> 
> &#8220;Basically,&#8221; he says, &#8220;SCO&#8217;s arguments are just too wrong to even discuss rationally. He adds: &#8220;They&#8217;re a cornered rat, and quite frankly, I think they have rabies to boot. I&#8217;d rather not get too close to them.&#8221; </blockquote>
