Ok, my (not so) local hardware store, [Komplett.ie][1] (which have their warehouse in Norway) now has an RSS Feed. Their feed is available [here][2] and shows the new instock stuff. very handy! i get an email from these every week or so, and this now makes it easer to see what i can spend my hard earned cash on! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> More gadgets for me!! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
