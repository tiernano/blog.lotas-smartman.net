this is a [very handy article][1] showing you how to convert DVDs to WMVs, and not only that, but theres a section [here][2] showing you how to convert them to Pocket PC WMV files. Well, actually, it doesent. i think i will be trying this tonight. unfortunitly, the only memory cards i have are 64mb and 128mb. so, i could encode about 2hrs of film at 128kbits/s, which wouldent be great, but it might work. we will see. now, for some bigger memory cards&#8230;
