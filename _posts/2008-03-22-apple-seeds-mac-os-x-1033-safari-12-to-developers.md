Apple continued the further development of Mac OS X 10.3 Panther this week with the first seedings of Mac OS X 10.3.3 build 7F24 and Safari 1.2 build 125. &#8220;Please test against these major areas of changes in this update: Graphics, OpenGL games, USB devices, printing, browsing networks, Cocoa applications,&#8221; Apple reportedly told developers in the seed notes accompanying the build. Of the several know issues with this first build, bugs associated with the system&#8217;s Bluetooth implementation appear to be the most prominent. Additional faults have been discovered with 500Mhz dual processor Power Mac G4 machines and system boot times. [[ActiveMac][1]]

I have already seen safari 1.2 on a bit torrent site, but it says it needs 10.3.3, so couldent get it. they dident have 10.3.3 on their so i couldent get that either. just for testing purposes of course&#8230;.
