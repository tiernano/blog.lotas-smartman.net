Ok, if all DNS stuff has been fixed, then in theory, my blog has been moved in house again. More in a while when i figure out if it has been moved&#8230; [update] yes. it has worked. so, i am running this on windows XP Pro, for the next few days, with MySQL 4.0 since i cant get PHP to talk to 4.1, on IIS with [Pipeboost][1] for compression and [ISAPI ReWrite][2] for the rewrite stuff. More about this later.
