A few weeks back i was thinking of getting a mac mini for my network. this was just after it had come out, it looked so cool, and i wanted it. well, the today was the day i was to get my mac mini. and i dident. but i did buy a new mac. i got me a new Apple Power Book G4 1.33Gz with 256mb ram and 60Gb hdd, combo drive, and a really sweet looking 15.2 inch wide screen display. this is really a nice machine! photos soon, but for now, i like. this was posted on my new power book! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> [Update] [there are some photos here of the power book][1].
