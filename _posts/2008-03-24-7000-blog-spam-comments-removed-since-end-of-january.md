Back on the <a class href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/archive/2007/01/28/comments-should-now-be-working-a-lot-better.aspx">28th Jan</a>, i enabled <a class href="http://www.akismet.com/">Akismet</a> to do comment spam checking. and since then it has blocked well over 7000 spam comments. only 2 have gotten through the shields. Thats pretty impressive! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> [update] today, another 850 has been cought, and thats only in 5 days!
