Ok. [this hack is handy for nokia users][1], but also for non nokia users. in theory, you should be able to hack any headset for phones, but if you break it, dont blame me or Engadget. It lets you modify the pop port to have standard headphone, or what ever you want to plug in. they actually mod it to have a head phone jack connector, so any 3.5mm headphones should work with it. this is very cool! i might try hacking the headphones on the XDA so i can get better headphones working with it!
