Mobility Guru has a [review of the HP Pavilion dv8000z][1], which is close to the model i have, the dv8025ea. only things they dident like is the lack of power with the graphics card (i dont play games so i havent noticed, but Glass in Vista works, so im happy there!) and the lack of TV tuner (again, i have a media center, so i dont need a tuner in this). havent fully read the review, but my one problem with it is the lack of 64bit drivers for it. HP are working on it, i have been told, but they dont know when it will be out&#8230;
