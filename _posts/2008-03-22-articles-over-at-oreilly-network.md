Right. i always check the [oreillynet.com][1] website for new interesting articles each day, but today there are 3 of interest to me. firstly, [Troubleshooting with Postfix Logs][2]. since my mail server runs postfix, this is a handy thing to have. next is [Configure Asterisk to work with VoIP services][3]. i want to try this, just because i (think i) can! Finally, [The next generation Internet &#8212; today!][4] this is something i have wanted to play with for a while. getting a new router working over the next day or so, so i can test this. anyway, check them out. very interesting.
