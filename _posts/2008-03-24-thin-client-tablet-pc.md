more news from Engadget: [a thin client table pc][1]. Interesting idea this. its a table PC with out a hard drive. all your data is stored on a central server. now heres an idea: how about a docking station for this for your computer in work. you could use this in meetings, etc, drag files from your main machine to this, which by the way has a 512mb flash storage card and runs windows xp embedded edition, and then bring it to meetings, or what ever. when you get back, it will sync with your main machine, copying changes. interesting none the less&#8230; [**updated**] its not a Table PC, its a tablet PC. sorry&#8230;
