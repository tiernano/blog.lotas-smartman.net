Ok. i have just started to play with [sharp MT][1], a little [Movabletype][2] client written in C#. Pretty nice interface. would like support for WYSIWYG support so i could post news direct from lets say [sharp reader][3] in ritch text and it convert it directly to HTML, like what [Radio Userland][4] does.
