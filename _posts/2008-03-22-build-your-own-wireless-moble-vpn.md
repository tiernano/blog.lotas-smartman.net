[Check out this oreillynet article on how to build a VPN][1]. Whats that to do with Wireless? [Palm has a list of VPN Clients for their products here][2]. couple that with a mobile phone and bluetooth, and the ip address of your machine thats acting as a VPN server and you have a VPN you can access from the bus on the way home and check your mail! when my PDA arrives, im getting this software and im testing it out. sounds like a cool idea!
