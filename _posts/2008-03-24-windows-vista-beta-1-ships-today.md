Scoble is saying that [Windows Vista BETA 1 will ship today][1], and that it will be on the MSDN Universal soon too! This will be sweet. i have to install this on a VPC or Virtual Server, and depending on a few things, i might (not totally sure yet) install it on the laptop, for fun (beta products are always fun <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> ). anyway, more info later.
