Check out this article on [how to get SPS to run on SQL2005][1], and improve preformance. [**note**] i have not tried this, and because SQL 2005 is not released, yet, i am not recomending this is a production environment, just yet. This is just for reference sake. i havent tested it, so dont take my word for it&#8230;
