Ok. i never posted this before because i though it might not be real, but it looks like Palm might have a [Treo 670 running Windows Mobile 5.0][1]. This would be really nice. not sure if it will actually be called the Treo 670, but thats what engadget are calling it. Not sure about specs either, but if any of the carriers in the states have their way, it probably wont have WiFi, which is a pain. the video is a bit blury but if this is real, which it now looks like it is, it will be very cool!
