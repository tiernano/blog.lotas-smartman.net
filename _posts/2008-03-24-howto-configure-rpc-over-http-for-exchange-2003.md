The lazy admin.com has [this article on how to get RPC over HTTP working for Exchange][1]. interesting read. i have to start playing with my exchange server and get it talking to the web again. It worked for a while, and then stoped. my mac now doesent get email from it, and i cant check mail remotly. i would also like to be able to check mail on my smartphone or pocket pc. Maybe thats a project for the weekend&#8230;
