Check out this [list of XMLHttpRequest and Ajax examples][1]. Lots of cool examples of Ajax in work. I want to start programming stuff with AJax backends, just to be able to say i can. it works quite well. [I like this one a lot][2]. Its kind of like Google Sugest, but the results are on the page as you type! very cool!
