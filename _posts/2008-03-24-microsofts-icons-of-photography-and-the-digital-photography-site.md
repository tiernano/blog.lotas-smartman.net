Check out [Microsoft&#8217;s Icons of photography site][1], which shows some extreamly cool photos from some pro photographers, with info about them, and what they use. Very cool stuff! Also, the [Pro Photographer site][2] has some downloads, articles and more for pro photographers using Windows, and the [main photography site][3] has cool stuff too.
