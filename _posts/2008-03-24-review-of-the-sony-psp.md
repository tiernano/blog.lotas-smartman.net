[The Register][1] has a [review of the new Playstation Portable][2].&nbsp;There are a few around the web, but this one i found first. Actually, Engadget has [this review&nbsp;back in December][3]. I like this. Hmmm. video player, mp3 player (is it actually MP3s or is it them damn sony things?) and some pretty sweet games! I might want one if Grand Tursimo gomes out for it!
