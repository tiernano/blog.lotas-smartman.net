Ok. i just got the mac working, and guess what? i need it! my workstation is not playing nicely with my ISA 2004 Server. because of this, i would usually be disconnected from the web. well, actually i probably wouldent. i **could** use my laptop, but me being lazy, started using the imac, and it works great. Currently playing with [OmniWeb][1] and it is pretty cool! i like [Safari][2], but omniweb has so many cool features. i would love to see these on a windows browser. the only gripe i currently have about my imac is its speed. at 333Mhz with 288Mb ram and OSX 10.3.5, its quite slow and has less power (In theory) then my Dell Axim X30 (624Mhz edition). But its cool. now to try out Office X 2004!
