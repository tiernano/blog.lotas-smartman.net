Enn are reporting that [a Costa Rican telco is trying to criminalise VoIP][1]. VoIP is pretty cool, and for telcos who have a monopoly on the phone market in a contry, its pretty scary since it can screw up their market. luckly Eircom havent done anything quite as stupid as this, even though they do some really stupid stuff!
