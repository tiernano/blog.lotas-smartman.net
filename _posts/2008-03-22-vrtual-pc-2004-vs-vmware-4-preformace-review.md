[Here is some preformace info][1] of VPC 2004 Versus VMWare 4 on a windows XP system&nbsp;under a AMD XP 2600+ CPU. interesting reading. Its pretty interesting to read, and has some benchmarks showing that VMWare is faster then VPC. That being said, VPC feels a lot better to use. and its more supported. its weird. under VMware all the newer OS&#8217;s like Longhorn have problems, but VPC just works. weird. anyway, check it out.
