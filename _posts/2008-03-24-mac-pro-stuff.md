With all the updates apple released on Tuesday, it seemed they forgot their most powerful machine, the [Mac Pro][1]. Well, they didn&#8217;t. some news about it!

The Mac Pro now has the option of a [PCI Express RAID Card][2]. Mind you, its a $999&nbsp;option, but Very cool!

It also got an update to the [SMC Firmware to 1.1][3], which does something to the way the fan works. Not sure what, yet, and haven&#8217;t installed it yet either, but handy to have.

Finally, and not just Mac Pro related, [Boot Camp 1.4][4] has been released. Still beta, but gets some new drivers, and some other bits a pieces. 

All Links thanks to [TUAW][5]. </p>
