[Bluetooth ActiveSync Guide for Windows XP Service Pack 2][1]. very interesting article. would same me a 28mb download of the MSI bluetooth drivers when i reinstall my system, though with a 1mb line, it doesent take a lot of time (roughly 4min or so!). Ohhh, and in unrelated news, NTL are upgrading parts of dublin to 1.5Mb connections if you have a 1mb line. Mine will be upgraded at the end of the month! SWEET!
