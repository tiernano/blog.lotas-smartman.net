Usually I donÂ’t talk a lot about upcoming CPU&#8217;s, other than the odd bit of news about [Quad core Laptop chips coming][1], but this [news via Engadget][2] made me very happy, and a little sad too&#8230; [Intel will be releasing a 6 core processor this year][3] [press release], with 8 core processors on there way&#8230;.

Not only that, but Hyper Threading is back, now with a new name of SMT, or Simultaneous Multithreading. So, on your 8 Core Xeon processor, you would have 16 threads running at one time, which means that, in theory, on a dual proc octo core machine, you would have 32 threads running. Does Windows see each of the SMT threads as a processor, the same as it did with HT enabled machines? 

Anyway, the reason it made me sad is now a single one of these processors is faster than my Dual proc, Dual Core Xeon Mac Pro&#8230; Might be time to upgrade soon after these come out&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

PS: one interesting thing from reading the press release: the Nehalem processor will have up to 8mb Level 3 cache, 731 Million Transistors and up to 25.8GB/S quick path interconnects&#8230; 731MILLION TRANSISTORS! that&#8217;s nearly 3/4 of a BILLION transistors! Man, that&#8217;s a lot!
