Ok, so this is one of those things I have though about, and then stopped thinking about, but now, found a solution, accidentally. Check out this post over at Smartphone and&nbsp;Pocket PC Mag showing you how to share your [Pocket PCs Internet connection over Wifi][1]. Its done with Java, and you basically have a proxy running on your Pocket PC to allow incoming connections. on what ever machine you then want to connect to the Internet with, you setup a P2P Wifi network, and go forth and download! not sure what to use this for though&#8230;.
