[RSS Agg 0.03][1] is out now and works with a new [mob blog][2] i have! Dataset caching works well too, and the only reason the page takes a bit of time to load is the fact that im on a 256kbit/s upload connection and the page is 100k+. ill probably limit the dataset to about the last 10 or 15 posts, maybe 20. at the moment i think its getting 5 feeds in total and each have a minimum of 10 posts, some up to 20. well, accept for the mobile blog which i only started last night. anyway, its working, and well too! code soon, hopefully!
