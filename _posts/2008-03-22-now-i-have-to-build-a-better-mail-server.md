the day after [i post the link to the final tutorial][1] on [ORiellynet][2] about building a better mail server, i have to build a better mail server. for some reason best know to someone esle, my mail server recived no mail last night. this is quite weird. also, some times norton antivirus gets confused (mainly due to the sheir amout of mail i get, up to 500+ peices a day) and blocks port 25. norton antivirus listens on port 25 for incomming and out going email, scans it and then sends it on. so, im now going to use the tutorial and a copy of [gentoo linux][3] and build a complete system just for email. i will probably also use [Squid][4] for my proxy and maybe [Samba][5] for file sharing. and i get to play with [DistCC][6] for building the whole lot! now to get it working under windows&#8230;  
** [update]** dont need it to work on windows anymore! just found [distccKNOPPIX][7], a bootable cd with distcc built in. so, i have my athlon 1.3Gz, dual athlon 2Gz, my parents P233 and my sisters P233. thats enough for a nice little cluster. ohh and the server with its duron 700Mhz. forgot that! sweet!
