right. just uploaded a new version of the [browser][1]to CVS. now using mozilla as a backend. <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> AT LAST! problem is the file is quite large. its currently over 11mb uncompressed. working on making a uploadable version so others can download and test. currently only on CVS! BUT IT WORKS!!!&nbsp;
