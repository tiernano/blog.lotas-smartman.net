Amazon has a new Web service for you to play with. its called the [S3, or Simple Storage Service][1]. it allows you to host files with sizes from 1Byte to 5Gigs, you can download them using either HTTP or Bittorrent, and there are a lot of other things you can do with this. Interesting pricing scheme too. you are charged 15c per Gig hosted per month and 20c per Gig transfered. Very interesting ideas here.
