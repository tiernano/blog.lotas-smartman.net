[this article][1] talks about a wireless protocol, 802.15.3, which could allow speeds of 100Mbits/s initially, but could be increased to 200 and 400Mbits/s! thats faster then my home network!!! They also mention that this could be only for distances of 10m or less, but you could use it for connecting your TV, Video, DVD player, and Hi-Fi all together without that tangled mess of wires. though if a techie doesent have wires, is he really a techie?
