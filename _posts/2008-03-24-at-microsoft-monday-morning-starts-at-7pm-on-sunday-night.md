I just found this post over at John Montgomery&#8217;s blog stating that [at Microsoft, Monday morning starts at 7pm on a Sunday night][1]. I like that. and&nbsp;I agree. i check my mail multiple times over the weekend, and a lot during the week. i have a smartphone, and i do a send and recieve of mail on that just to check. same with my Pocket PC. its just one of those things i suppose. Is it just a &#8220;Microsoft Thing&#8221; or do others do this?
