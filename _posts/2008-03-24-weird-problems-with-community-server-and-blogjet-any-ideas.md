I have been having this problem for a few days now, and i cant figure out what the problem is. I have started testing [BlogJet][1] as my main blogging tool, but when used in conjunction with [CommunityServer][2] and [Flickr][3], there are some weird problems. If i post an image from [Flickr][3], [CommunityServer][2] removes the src attribute from the img tag and only leaves the alt attribute. If i check the src, it just shows <img alt=&rdquo;whatever&rdquo;>. But when i check the code in the back (in the CS admin section) the src attribute is there, the image displays in the preview, but on the frontpage it doesent! ARGH! Any ideas?
