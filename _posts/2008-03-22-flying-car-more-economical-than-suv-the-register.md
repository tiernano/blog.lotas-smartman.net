[Flying Car more economical than SUV | The Register][1]  


> The M400 needs 35 clear feet to take off but thanks to its 770 hp engine can whiz to 365 mph &#8211; cruise control kicks in at 326 mph &#8211; and climb at 6,400 feet per minute. You may hear it before you see it: it emits a rather noisy 65 dba at 500 feet. Interestingly, with a fuel consumption of 20 miles to the gallon on the road, it&#8217;s rather more economical than a Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) and looks positively eco-friendly compared to a Hummer.</p>
Sounds interesting. I could be in work in minutes, but have to find a place to take off&#8230;.
