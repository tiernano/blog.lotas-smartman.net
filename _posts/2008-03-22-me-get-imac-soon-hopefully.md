I am adding an iMac G3 (pink, fucking **PINK**!) to my network tomorrow sometime. i have to go to Sligo, but before i get to Sligo, i have to go to Galway to get to Sligo. well, not really, but im going to Galway to get the iMac! Mad stuff! Anyway, it wont be on my actual network till about sunday some time, but when i get it home it will be sweet and photos will be posted! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> because i wont be near a computer with an internet connection i wont be blogging that much, unless i get my bluetooth adapter to work with the imac and my phone talking to it while im there. i know my friend im staying with doesent have broadband, or at least i dont think he does. anyway, photos will be posted to the [Mobile blog][1].
