is [this the Orange SPV M3000][1]? Looks quite interesting. the keyboard comes out of the side, insted of the bottom in the blueangel, and it looks like the keys are bigger then then ones from the blueangel too. it doesent say what speed processor it has, but it does have Windows Mobile 5.0. This is if its true, that is. Pretty cool!
