Well, i wanted to do a podcast tonight, i also wanted to get my Exchange 2003 server up and running, and also do some playing with ISA2004, but insted i went shopping. Typical. i get a car and i have to drive to the shopping center. it wasent all that bad though. i did pick up a copy of the Oreilly Book, Windows Server Cookbook (linked below). I got to read some of it for a while in the shopping center, and it looks pretty cool. Anyway, maybe a podcast tomorrow?
