I have had a [media center for nearly a year now][1], and i have fallen in love with it. its pretty damn sweet! i love being able to record TV and watch it later, or even while its still recording. i love pausing live TV and getting coffee, and starting back where i left off. i love being able to rewind live TV too! i also love starting to watch a TV show, pausing it for about 5 or so minuites while getting coffee or stuff, and then watching it, fast forwarding ads when they come on, and just watch the &#8220;good stuff&#8221;. now with the big TV, it should make my TV watching experiance even more interesting!
