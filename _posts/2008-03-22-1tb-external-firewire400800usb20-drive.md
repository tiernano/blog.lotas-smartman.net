[LaCie have released a new 1Terabyte][1] (yeah, 1 thousand Gigs!) External USB2.0/Firewire 400/800 drive. it looks quite cool. it works with USB1.1/2/Firewire 400/800, but i dont think USB1.1 will be too handy for it. it would take 9 days to back up 1Tb to this over a USB 1 connection! they say it will &#8220;*store nearly two years of continuous music and up to one month of non-stop MPEG-2 video&#8221;*! thats my kind of backup system!
