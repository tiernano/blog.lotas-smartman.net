[The register][1] has an [interesting article here][2]. they say long horn is been given to attendies of the PDC (Professional Developer Conference) and its already on the net. there are [Screen shots and info here][3] and more [here][4]. looks pretty cool, but 2 years away. Also, this is windows 6. 2k was 5.0 and xp was 5.1. win2003 server was 5.2. so its a totally new build.
