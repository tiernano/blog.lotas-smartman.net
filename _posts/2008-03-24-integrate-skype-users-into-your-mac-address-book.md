Check out this [MacOSX hints article on how to integrate Skype user names into osx&#8217;s Address book][1]. Pretty cool. i supose, you could cheat one way with Outlook. if you add a URL to the users name with &#8220;callto:&#8221; infront of their skype username, when you click, skype will load and make the call. only thing is you get a warning when you try this from outlook. Still, its interesting. Now if there was a way to properly integrate Skype with Outlook, and support the Pocket PC too, that would be really cool.
