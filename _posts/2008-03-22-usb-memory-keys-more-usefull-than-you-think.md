Im currently listening to [FM104][1] over the internet. its streaming over the web @ 20kbits/s. im just working out that @ 20kbits/s, 1 hour of audio works out at 9mb. my usb memory key is currently 128mb in total. thats 14 hours of music. now, i know that the audio quality is nowhere near CD quality, but its good and listenable. so, even @ lets say 40k/s, you still get 7 hours of audio. its better then the 2 &#8211; 4 hours of cd quality audio. im in work for about 8 hours a day. with 20k/s i would never hear the same song twice! hmmmm. interesting. so, now to find a quick way of converting mp3&#8217;s into wma&#8217;s. could be interesting. im not even going to try this for CDs. i dont think i have enough time to hear 77 hours of audio on a 700mb disc!! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> haha.
