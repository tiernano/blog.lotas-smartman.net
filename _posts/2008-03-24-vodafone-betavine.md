Well, Vodafone now have a similar service, called [Vodafone BetaVine][2]. With Betavine, you can send SMS messages, WAP push and also location based services. what happens around location, i am not sure. i have to play around with this and check it out, but this is very cool. By signing up, you are given 100 credits. it cost 1 credit to send an SMS message, and your credits are refreshed at the start of each month. there is info about this in section 1.2 of the [API reference][3].
