I have been informed that a company called [Netsource][1] are offering DSL at really cheap rates compared to the competition here in Ireland (main competition [IOL][2] and [Eircom][3]). Well if you actually look at the sites, you will see IOL are charging &euro;49.49 a month, but with a 5Gb cap. Eircom are charging &euro;54.45 (&euro;45 ex vat) with a 4Gb cap. Netsource are charing &euro;45 ex vat (&euro;54.45 inc vat) but no bandwidth cap is there. I already have [NTL Cable modem][4] into the house, but because of the web server from home, more bandwidth, plus the dedicated IP given by netsource will come in handy. And then you have [this!][5]. The nextland Pro800Turbo. Its a router with 2 wan connections. Strangly enough, if everything works out well, there will be about 4 routers in the house. The ADSL modem im getting, or looking at getting anyway, has a built in router. My cable modem is pluged into a router, which ill probably leave there, if i can. the nextland may want the modem direct. the nextland will then talk to either the cable router, or modem direct, the DSL router, cause i have no modem direct, and then have a connection to an other router, my wireless router, if i get it. so for the wireless network, to get to the net ill be adding at least 2 &#8211; 4 hops before i leave the building!!! wahoo! real bedroom datacentre!!! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
