finally! i got HSCSD working with my pda and phone! how you may ask? piece of software from <a href=\"http://www.novamedia.de\">www.novamedia.de</a> called \&#8221;mobile high speed data for palm os\&#8221; not free unfortunitly, but the demo works grand! \[originally posted on the PDA, modded on the PC\] (update) this software is a pain in the arse! when you make a connection, no matter to what, is says this is trial software, bla bla bla.cost about EUR20 but not sure if its worth it yet. we will see.
