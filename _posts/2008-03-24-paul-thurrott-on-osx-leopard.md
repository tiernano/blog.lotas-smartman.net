[check out this post by Paul Thurrott on Leopard][1] and its &#8220;New&#8221; features. two favourite quotes:  
* 

1. Time Machine. &#8220;With Mac OS X Leopard and Time Machine &#8230; you can go back in time to recover anything you’ve ever backed up. Time Machine’s time-based browser [lets you] see a snapshot of how your entire system looked on any given day — file by file.&#8221; Wow, neat. It was especially neat when Microsoft included it in Windows Server 2003 over three years ago and called it Volume Shadow Copy. And yes, Windows Vista has it too, built right-in. It even has the backup stuff. Obviously.

2. Mail 3.0. This might just be my favorite one, because even a normal person will see this for the BS hyperbole it is (Time Machine will fool people that don&#8217;t know any better). Leopard’s Mail includes breakthrough new features that have never been seen before in a Mail application: Mail Stationery, templates, Mail Notes, To Dos [with iCal integration], and RSS news feed [compatibility].&#8221; I keep waiting for someone else to laugh. Those aren&#8217;t seriously the &#8220;new&#8221; features are they?
