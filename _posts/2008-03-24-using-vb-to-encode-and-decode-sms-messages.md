Check out this Code project article showing you [how to encode SMS messages using VB][1], and this one showing you [how to decode them][2]. it also shows you how to send them using HyperTerminal. I cant seem to get it working, just yet, but i will be trying it later over bluetooth! This could be interesting to get both together and some com port programming software and make an SMS Sender and Reciver!
