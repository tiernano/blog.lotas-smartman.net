Ok. im sitting looking at [RSS Bandit][1] (well, technically, looking at the text im writing but dont be so p<span lang=EN-IE style="mso-ansi-language: EN-IE">edantic) loading after a cold boot and it took it about a minuite (including the time it took me to work out how to spell p<span lang=EN-IE style="mso-ansi-language: EN-IE">edantic) to load. I am subscribed to a lot of feeds (over 300, and growing nearly every day). </span></span>

<span lang=EN-IE style="mso-ansi-language: EN-IE"><span lang=EN-IE style="mso-ansi-language: EN-IE">My problem is that 300 feeds take a lot of time to load. each one takes time then to do other calculations, etc. And im just thinking, why not use SQL server? </span></span>

<span lang=EN-IE style="mso-ansi-language: EN-IE"><span lang=EN-IE style="mso-ansi-language: EN-IE">Now&nbsp;I dont expect the RSS Bandit guys to go off and build the next version of RSS bandit to **just** work on SQL server, but more along the lines of &#8220;if you want to use XML as the backend, compile with this code. if you want SQL in the back, use this code&#8221;. I have been meening to look at the code that puts stuff into the XML backend, and takes it back out, but hopefully it is modular. if it is, i might just give it a shot my self! </span></span>

<span lang=EN-IE style="mso-ansi-language: EN-IE"><span lang=EN-IE style="mso-ansi-language: EN-IE">This could just be the biggest over kill for an RSS reader, but i could be wrong. i can see the download site now:</span></span>

<span lang=EN-IE style="mso-ansi-language: EN-IE"><span lang=EN-IE style="mso-ansi-language: EN-IE">RSS Bandit 1.3.0.29 (XML Backend) &#8211; 3.9mb</span></span>

<span lang=EN-IE style="mso-ansi-language: EN-IE"><span lang=EN-IE style="mso-ansi-language: EN-IE">RSS Bandit 1.3.0.29.1 (SQL Backend) &#8211; **70Mb**&#8230;</span></span>

<span lang=EN-IE style="mso-ansi-language: EN-IE"><span lang=EN-IE style="mso-ansi-language: EN-IE">Though, in theory, it should make browsing a lot faster&#8230;.</span></span>

<span lang=EN-IE style="mso-ansi-language: EN-IE"><span lang=EN-IE style="mso-ansi-language: EN-IE">PS: i know this could be taken as a stupid idea, but i dont care&#8230;</span></span>
