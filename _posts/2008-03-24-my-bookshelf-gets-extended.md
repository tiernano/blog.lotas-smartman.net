I got me a few new books to start reading. there is a photo [here][1] of the two new books. They are: [MCSA/MCSE Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-284): Implementing and Managing Microsoft Exchange Server 2003][2] and [MCAD/MCSE/MCDBA Self-Paced Training Kit: Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Database Design and Implementation, Exam 70-229, Second Edition][3]. Nice long title names from Amazon there, and there is a lot of pages in total. The Exchange book is 700 pages, and the SQL book weights in at 1000 pages. and speaking of weight, the SQL book is 3.5lbs and the Exchange book is 3.9Lbs. thats 1.5 and 1.7Kgs. I hope the book shelf will hold all these, and the rest of the books i have&#8230;
