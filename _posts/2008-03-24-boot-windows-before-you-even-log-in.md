Check out this tip over at [BrainFuel  
showing you how to get your computer to boot the desktop a lot quicker after  
restarting your machine][1]. They way its done is you set the system to Auto  
Login with your account, and then lock it as soon as its done. So, for me i tell  
my machine to reboot, it takes about a minuite to get from BIOS to Windows  
Login, and then nearly 2 min to get to the fully working desktop. With this, i  
tell it to reboot, go off, and it loads everything in the back ground. i then  
come back, log in as my self, and have everything there and running! Handy! [[via
