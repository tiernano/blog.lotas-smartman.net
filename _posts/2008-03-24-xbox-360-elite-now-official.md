<a class href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/03/28/xbox-360-elite-now-official/">Engadget has some cool info</a> on the XBox 360 Elite. Channel 10 also has <a class href="http://www.on10.net/Blogs/tina/exclusive-video-first-look-at-the-xbox-elite/">a video about it</a>. Not only that, but the 120Gb hdd will be available for original 360 owners soon too!
