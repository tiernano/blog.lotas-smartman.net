The [MetaWeblog API][1] is one of those interesting APIs that a lot of people couldn&#8217;t live without (as a blogger, I should know). and this post over at Laurent Kemp√©&#8217;s blog shows you [how to enable one of the new features, the newMedaObject, in C#][2]. this takes a few things, including an object (image, mp3, etc) and posts it to a server, and then returns a URL for that object. Very handy!
