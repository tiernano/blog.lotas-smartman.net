[How-To Turn your iPod in to a Universal Infrared Remote Control &#8211; Features &#8211; features.engadget.com][1]. Hmmm. im not sure if i like this idea. mainly because you have to record all the different &#8220;sounds&#8221; your controls use to make it work right. and thats probably for each button too. I like, how ever, the idea of making my PPC act as a remote control. now that would be cool. its been done, im just not searching for it now!
