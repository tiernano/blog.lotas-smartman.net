Wahoo!!! my workstation is working fully now. well semi fully. have to get bluetooth working, my sound card (not sure which one, theres 2!) working and my mouse working properly. i have my graphics working grand, my network and a lot of other stuff. installed Evolution, the [Gnome][1] email client, Gnome its self, [Mozilla][2], [Opera][3], [Openoffice][4], and a few other things. [KDE][5] is currently building, so that hopefully will be done by the time i get home. theres quite a lot of email to get though, so thats why evolution is there.  
Im still looking at the fixing the XP Chips to get the running as dual processors. not sure if it will work. ill post more after.
