I have decided to get a new router. Im getting a [3Com][1] OfficeConnect Cable/DSL Gateway. Havent found any reviews for it yet, so i may write one up when i get it <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> Actually, i just found [this][2]. Interesting read. The price of the router is quite cheap at .62, and the reason i say cheap is the review says Â£100+ ex vat! which works out at over .160! Anyway, check out [This page][3] for the place im buying it!
