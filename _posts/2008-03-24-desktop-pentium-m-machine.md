[this review over at Game PC.com][1] is reviewing a Pentium M Desktop system. The advantages of a Pentium M system are low power requirements, low heat disapation and therefore a quite fan is needed to cool it, and its actually quite powerfull. Unfortuitly the site has been slashdotted, but hopefully i will get to read this soon. I can already think of at least 2 good uses for it. a media center PC and a home server. Interesting&#8230;
