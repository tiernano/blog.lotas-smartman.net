So, some quick update links for today. Firstly [Windows Media Player 11 for XP has been released][1]. Go forth and download. Next, [10 expert tips on Windows Vista RC2][2] (i wonder how may will work on RTM&#8230;). Next, [Microsoft Office accounting Express 2007 is available for Free][3]. I have to play with that one. [IE7 official addons site][4]. [IO Data&#8217;s new HDLM GWin Windows storage server][5]. Very nice! i want one (or 2) of these!
