[this review over at PC Tech Forums][1] reviews [MandrakeMove][2]. this is a new portable linux distribution. looks quite cool actually too. the thing i really like is the USB Key support. all your files and settings are stored to the key, so it acts as you /home directory. this would be handy for using in work or school. USB key support isent supported in the betas, but is due to be supported soon. there is Office software, games, educational apps, and 3d programs and more. if you buy the full copy you also get a USB Key with it! and you also get add ons like the NVidia drivers, Acrobat reader, real player, flash and the mandrakemove docs. looks quite cool. i think ill be downloading this when it comes out fully!!!
