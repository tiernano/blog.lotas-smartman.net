<a href=\"http://nypost.com/business/17300.htm\">The Ny Post is reporting that Microsoft could buy AOL from Time Warner</a>. the funniest thing about this, if i remember correctly is that AOL bought TimeWarner (comment if im wrong) and now its Time warner selling AOL! Total reversal of fortune. Anyway <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2004/03/19/news/companies/aol_microsoft/index.htm?cnn=yes\">CNN are also talking about it</a>. a lot of speculation by the looks of things&#8230;.
