RIAA sue 800+ people for swapping music. News post [here.][1] Funny question. What will the RIAA do if they do kill all P2P file sharing and still are loosing money? what hapeens when they have just broke even on suing what ever many people and then find out that they are still making less money over last year. the reason why the RIAA made less money one year over the other is they stoped selling tapes, September 11, the economic downlturn and more money have less money to spend of Cds. then in last position is the downloading of music off the net.
