I just got me a [Pownce Account][1] which is very cool! If you want one, check out [Invite Share][2]. its an invite sharing site. That&#8217;s how I got my Pownce account. There are one or 2 problems with Invite Share though. I told it I sent 6 invites, but it only accounted for 4. some minor bugs, and load issues, but for a site that&#8217;s about a week old, its not bad. Considering they reckon they got half a million hits in that 7 days, they doing well!
