[PC Card maker touts &#8216;seamless&#8217; Wi-Fi, 3G access | The Register][1]. now thats a cool thing to have. walking though town with a tablet pc and being able to hope from wifi to GPRS to 3G (when ever it arives here!) without any problems. only problem would be walking into walls or people, but that can be solved.
