Check out [this site][1]. live news cast of the snooker. watching it on TV here. Ken Doherty (The Dublin Player!) V Mark Williams (From Wales). Currently 16 all of 35. First to 18. Final section. Check out the link for more info. **Update:** Unfortunitly, Doherty Lost the match, 18 to 16. Williams finished with a break of 77 to win the 34th frame. He wins Â£200 Thousand Plus. Â£245k or something. i would have liked to see Doherty to win. But it was a good match so far! Congrats to Williams!
