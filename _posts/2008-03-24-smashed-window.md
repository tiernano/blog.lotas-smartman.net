My poor car&#8230; Found it like this this morning. very sad day. Well, when i say i found it like this, we cleaned up and tried fixing it with a towel. that dident work, so we tried cling film. that also fell apart at 60MPH+, so, that went away. So, i drove home from Sligo with no window&#8230;. VERY COLD!
