Hmmm. something interesting i just found out. My smartphone does not produce EXIF data. This is a bit of a pain. Since i got my Fuji Film FinePix A310, i have been using both iPhoto and Adobe Album to store photos. both read EXIF data and figure out stuff like date and time, what camera took the photo, and other interesting things. i also found [this EXIF reader writtin in .NET a few months back][1] which i wanted to add to a project i was thinking about writing, and getting data from EXIF would have been cooler. plus date/time info isent always saved correctly in the file (created date i mean) but it would be in EXIF. now if only i could get an extender&#8230;.
