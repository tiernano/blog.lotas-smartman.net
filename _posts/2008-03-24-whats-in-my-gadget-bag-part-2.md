Well, its been a while since i did a [contents of my gadget bag post][1], so here i go again. its been about&nbsp;8 months, and im carrying a lot more stuff then i did back then. No photos, yet (maybe later) but here is the list.

Depending on the day, i carry 2 bags with me. one holds the laptops and quite a lot of other stuff, the other is my camera bag.

Contents of the laptop bag:

Power cables for Laptops  
Microsoft Bluetooth Mouse and Adapter  
Microsoft Laptop Mouse  
Sony Headphones

The Camera bag is a little less cluttered, but still has the following:

Canon 55-200MM Lens (USM)  
Canon battery Grip (and second adapter for battery grip to allow use of AA Batteries)

Finally, the stuff i carry in my pockets:
