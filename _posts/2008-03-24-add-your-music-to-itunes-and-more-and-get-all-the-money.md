Hmmm, interesting. [TuneCore][1] is a new site that allows you&nbsp;to sell your music on iTunes (US, Europe, Canada, Japan, Austrilia and UK) and Rhapsody, and more soon, and keep anything that is given to you by iTunes or who ever. there are some small charges for some of the itunes stores (US is free by the looks of things) and the charge is just for the storage of the music. pretty interesting idea. I wonder how many artists will sign up&#8230;
