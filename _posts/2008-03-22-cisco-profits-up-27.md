  CHICAGO (Reuters) &#8211; Cisco Systems Inc. (NasdaqNM:<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=csco&d=t">CSCO</a></p> 
  
  <p>
    &#8211; <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/n/c/csco.html">News</a>) on Tuesday said
  </p>
  
  <p>
    quarterly net income rose 27 percent, but the data networking equipment maker
  </p>
  
  <p>
    broke with tradition by failing to top Wall Street estimates, and its shares
  </p>
  
  <p>
    dropped.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;I kind of consider this a miss, because they usually beat by a penny,&#8221; said
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Shawn Campbell, principal of Chicago-based Campbell Asset Management, who does
  </p>
  
  <p>
    not own Cisco shares but follows the stock closely, of Cisco&#8217;s results.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Cisco shares fell 6 percent in after-hours trade on Instinet after closing at
  </p>
  
  <p>
    $18.86 on the Nasdaq.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Cisco said quarterly profit rose due to market share gains in the high-end,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    high-profit router and switch businesses even as weak corporate spending pushed
  </p>
  
  <p>
    revenue lower.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The San Jose, California-based company reported a net profit in its fiscal
  </p>
  
  <p>
    fourth quarter of $982 million, or 14 cents a share, compared with a net profit
  </p>
  
  <p>
    of $772 million, or 10 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Cisco has posted its three best quarterly net profits in the last three
  </p>
  
  <p>
    quarters, as it steals customers from its rivals in the cutthroat market for
  </p>
  
  <p>
    the routers and switches that direct traffic on networks.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Excluding one-time items, Cisco earned 15 cents a share.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On that basis, analysts had expected Cisco to post a fourth-quarter profit
  </p>
  
  <p>
    before one-time items of 15 cents a share on sales of $4.68 billion, according
  </p>
  
  <p>
    to Reuters Research, a unit of Reuters Group Plc.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sales in the quarter ended July 26 fell to $4.70 billion from $4.83 billion,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    amid tight corporate spending, but rose slightly from the third quarter&#8217;s $4.62
  </p>
  
  <p>
    billion.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said in May the company expected
  </p>
  
  <p>
    fourth-quarter sales to be even with the third quarter. However, when pressed,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    he said he had an upward bias on the expected sales.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;Some people look at the United States and feel the economy is turning a
  </p>
  
  <p>
    corner, and some of Cisco&#8217;s peers&#8217; recent results made some sell-side analysts
  </p>
  
  <p>
    more optimistic,&#8221; said Rob Siewert, an analyst with Victory Capital Management,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    a Cleveland-based asset management company that owns Cisco shares.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Smaller rival Juniper Networks Inc. (NasdaqNM:<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=jnpr&d=t">JNPR</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8211; <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/n/j/jnpr.html">News</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ) last month forecast sales in the third quarter would be flat from the
  </p>
  
  <p>
    previous quarter, slightly above Wall Street expectations.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Spending by corporate customers, which accounts for about 80 percent of Cisco&#8217;s
  </p>
  
  <p>
    sales, has slumped in the weak economy. Demand in the beleaguered telecom
  </p>
  
  <p>
    sector, which accounts for the rest of Cisco&#8217;s sales, has slumped drastically
  </p>
  
  <p>
    over the past two years.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Cisco shares fell to $17.70 on Instinet in after-hours trading on Tuesday,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    after closing at $18.86 on the Nasdaq.
