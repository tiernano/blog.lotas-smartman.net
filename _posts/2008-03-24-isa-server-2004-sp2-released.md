[ISA Server 2004 SP2 has been released][1]. This release includes some cool featrues, including:

  * Support for BITS Caching
  * HTTP Compression
  * Traffic Prioritization
  * Extended Branch Office Interoperability

Very cool release. I will be installing this soon on a box (actually, i need a new box&#8230; hmmmm). hopefully the HTTP compression works for outgoing traffic and same with the Traffic Prioritization&#8230; Handy for running internal servers&#8230;
