I mentioned before that i was looking at [getting a new board, chips, hard drives][1] and [laptop.][2]. Well i have the idea of buying the [motherboard][3] first, the [chips][4], [HDDs][5] and then [laptop][2]. but, and this is where you come in, does anyone know if i can use a single AMD Athlon CPU in the board while im waiting for my MP CPUs? I want to get the board in the next few weeks, and need to know this first. Im actually just downloading their manual now ([Rev 1.03][6] and [Rev 1.00][7]) so hopefully its in there. maybe i dont need help after all! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> BTW, the FAQ doesent have it but its [here][8]. Doesent say anything in the manual and [this page][9] says it only supports MP chips. Pity. will this meen i have a box for about 8 weeks?! wahhhh! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />
