Quite aside from the thrill &#8212; for some small definition thereof, certainly &#8212; of seeing a Web server running on your phone, the app is useful for sharing any snapshots taken with your cameraphone live on the Internet.
> 
> Make a GPRS connection using any network-aware application on your phone (Opera works nicely), launch VS HTTPd, select Options > Start, and visit the IP address shown on your mobile\&#8217;s screen using any Web browser. There are a few additional settings available to you, allowing for different root and photo directories.</p>

> I managed to visit my phone from the Opera Web browser running on my phone itself, but not from anywhere in the outside world &#8212; outside of T-Mobile\&#8217;s GPRS service, that is.</p>
