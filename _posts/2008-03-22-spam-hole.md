[Spam hole][1] is quite an interesting idea. waste the bandwidth of the spammers on a mega scale. they see a open relay, but all the email that is recived is just removed. they think its a fully open relay, send a few thousand emails to it but its just junked! cool! wonder will it work though. im not sure i want my mail server acting as a fake open relay though either. still, handy idea.
