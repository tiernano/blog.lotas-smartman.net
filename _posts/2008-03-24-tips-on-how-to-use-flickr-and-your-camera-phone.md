Lifehacker has some tips on [how to use Flickr and your camera phone effectivly][1]. Very cool stuff. I did not realise you could add tags to your photo just by adding the tags: to your subject. anything after that is used as a tag. you can also add the words +private, +friends, +family or +ff to your special email address flickr give you, to set the security on your photos too. Very cool stuff!
