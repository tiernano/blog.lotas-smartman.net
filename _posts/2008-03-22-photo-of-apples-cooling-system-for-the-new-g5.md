[Gizmodo has a photo of the cooling system in the new apple G5 2.5Gz systems][1] which are due out soon. only problem is there where more photos but apple asked [tech seekers][2] to take them down. the tech seekers link was the source of the photos. pity. the photo thats left there looks interesting.
