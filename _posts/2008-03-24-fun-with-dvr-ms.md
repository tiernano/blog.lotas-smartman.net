DVR-MS is the format Windows Media Center records to from the TV Tuner. I have always wanted to play with this format (trimming TV Shows, removing segments from the middle (\*cough\* Ads \*cough\*), and just generally larking about with the format. Well, Stephen Toub has a post on his blog (which was originally posted on the MSDN site, but, as he mentions on the blog, has disappeared) which [talks about using API&#8217;s to talk to DVR-MS files][1]. Very cool stuff! Now all I need to do is start to play! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
