[check out this post][1] from Darren Neimke&#8217;s Blog. Very cool read. i am already thinking of how to use this. In theory, i could have code some time soon for you that shows you how to zip your Data set, send over the wire, and then unzip it on the other size. dont know about speed yet though&#8230; more about that later&#8230;
