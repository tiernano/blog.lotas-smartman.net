[NeedToKnow: WiFi PDAs&#8217; Dirty Little Secret : TomsNetworking : News, reviews and how-tos for knowledgeable networkers.][1] Interesting read, but i would like to see how the new Axim x30 fairs in speed, or even the x3 with built in wifi. They show you what its like with a SD wifi card, but would it not be better to shell out the extra couple of quid for a built in wifi card insted of an extra one?
