Anandtech has a <a class href="http://www.anandtech.com/storage/showdoc.aspx?i=2949">review of the new Hatichi Deskstar 7K1000</a>, which is&nbsp;a 1Tb hdd. This has gotten me thinking. With the building of the <a class href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/archive/2007/03/07/a-dual-core-pc-just-cost-me-about-eur250.aspx">low price, dual core 64 bit machine</a> 2 weeks ago, and the fact that upgrading that to Intel Core 2 Duos would be only about 100 quid more, i have though about upgrading my media center. Ideally, a small form factor case would be nice, but it has to house a couple of hard drives (probably 2, but posibally 4), a DVD Writer and 2 TV cards. Anyway, just thoughs at the moment, but 2 or 3 of these (or even 4) in a RAID arry would be very sweet! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
