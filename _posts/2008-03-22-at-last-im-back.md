Wahoo! sorry about that, but for some reason my Linux box has been going weird latly. it crashed there when i was in work, and it crashed yesterday too. So, Now, or shortly, the server will be running off 2 machines. my workstation is the front end (Dual Athlon 2Gz, 512mb ram, windows XP, Apache 2, PHP 4.3) and my win2k3server is the backend (700Mhz Duron, 512mb ram, windows 2003 server, MySQL 4.0).
