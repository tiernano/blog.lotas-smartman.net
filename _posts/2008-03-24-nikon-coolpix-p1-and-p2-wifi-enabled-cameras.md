Nikon has released 2 new cameras: [the P1 and the P2][1], both with ability to send photos to your home computer over wifi. you need special software for this to work, so not just any computer (without the software) will work, but its still pretty cool. also, it doesent state if you need the PC to have wifi, or just network connectivity&#8230; Anyway, look cool.
