Since i will be using OneNote on my OQO for handwritten notes, and also would like to sync it with my PC at home, i started looking for information about syncing notes with multiple machines. Chris Pratley has a [post on his blog][1] explaining how to do this for multiple different ways. he goes into details about Syncing from 2 home machines (laptop and desktop), work and home machines and more. Very cool stuff.
