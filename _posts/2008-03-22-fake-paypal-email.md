I just got this email from what looked like varify@paypal.com. Took me a while to find out it actually wasent them. not sure who sent it, but its not from a paypal server. also the URL looks like paypal.com but it is actually worldISP.com Thier Security cert is owned by them too. looks fairly real. i just emailed webmaster@paypal.com about this, but not sure what else to do. first one of these i found. I just sent it to the bugtraq mailing list. This is the source of the email.
