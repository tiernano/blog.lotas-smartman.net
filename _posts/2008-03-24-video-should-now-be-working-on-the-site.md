Well, i say should, but you will have to confirm that. there are currently 2 videos posted on the site:

[Blaise Aguera y Arcas: Photosynth demo at TED][1]

and 

[Microsoft Surface Computing Demo][2]

All seems to be grand on my end&#8230; The problem is that Community Server strips out certin tags for security. for more on that, [check out this post on the CS Forums][3].

so, hopefully we be all good!
