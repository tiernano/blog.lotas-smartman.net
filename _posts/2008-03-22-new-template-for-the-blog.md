Okey dokey. i decided i wanted a change for my site. so i changed it. i want to make a few more modifications but cant for a while. ill install [VMware][1] with win2k or XP later. So what do you think? It works grand on IE6, Opera 7.11 and Netscape 6, which is all i have access to here now. ill test galeon with mozilla 1.3.1 and mozilla 1.3.1 and (hopefully) konquerer (if its built yet) when i get home.
