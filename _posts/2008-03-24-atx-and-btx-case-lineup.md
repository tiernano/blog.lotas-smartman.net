[Toms Hardware has a line up of ATX and BTX Cases][1]. The Thermaltake one looks really cool! This is what i want wrapped around my new system! It weighs 44Lbs! thats 20Kg! and thats without components! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Ohhh and its water cooled! I wonder will it cool 2 Opteron 275 (or greater) processors, 2 large graphics cards (wont be in SLI, but may support it) and maybe cooling for hard drives? That would rock! Its a little expencive at $420 without a power supply, or at least i dont think it comes with one, but man is it sweet! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
