Right. i have just installed windows xp on my workstation. reasons? well, linux for a start was having problems with my TV card (2.6.0 seems to have lost support for my BTTV type card and i couldent play my PS2). secondly, sound has been dead for a few weeks now, so i need that. also, im going to start studying VB.net in college, so i need that.
