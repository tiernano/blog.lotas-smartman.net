Ok. because christmas is comming up and because my room is in a complete and utter mess, i should probably start cleaning up and moving stuff around. rerouting wires, moving things on desks and probably moving desks! so, this is the perfect time to start work on moving my server in house. i will try and aim for a sunday turn on, but i cant garentee it. i will update you over the weekend, and i probably wont get a lot posted over the weekend, but i will try. i have also been very busy over the last week, so thats why i have a lack of posts. hopefully, that will be fixed soon.
