John from Windows Connected has a post showing you [how to build a Bootable WinPE 2.0 USB key][1]. could be handy I suppose. I still don&#8217;t know enough about Windows PE to be able to know exactly what it can do, so I wont comment, but its interesting. USB keys are getting extremely cheap, and large. Last week I got an email from somewhere (I have bought stuff from them and asked to be kept informed,&nbsp;so it wasn&#8217;t spam) and they had 4Gb keys for about 20Pounds Sterling, and 8Gb keys for a little over 60. Ok, there not the fasted drives on the market, or even branded, but 8Gb on a stick! Cool!</p>
