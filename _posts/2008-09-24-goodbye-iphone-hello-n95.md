Well, it finally happened. I have replaced my aging and battered [iPhone][1] with the [Nokia N95][2] i won a couple of months back. The iPhone finally pushed me over the top today: something crashed in the background and it used all its battery, processor power, etc, to, well, fail. the back of the iphone got REALLY hot, and then it ran out of battery. Funny thing though: When Apple talked about the 2.0 software, they joked that a taskmanager was not required, and it would be silly to have one&#8230; well, today i would have found it useful, killing that app&#8230; and its not just today either&#8230; Its happened a few times so far. i am not a happy customer&#8230;

But on the bright side, i do have the replacment up and running. The N95, during my testing of it (i never put it into "production"&#8230;) was a very worthy successor&#8230; we will see how it goes over the next couple of weeks&#8230;
