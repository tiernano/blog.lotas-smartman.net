[this slashdot article][1] talks about a company called [Star roms][2] who are selling roms for [Mame][3]. Their list of roms is [here][4]. Hmmm. [pricing][5] between $2 and $6. theres lots of atair games and its based on a credits system for the purchase. ohh and you get 15 free for signing up. only 1 or 2 games can be gotten for 15 credits though. the site is a bit slow now because of the slashdot effect. Pretty cool idea. hopefully they will have more roms later! How approprate! Each credit costs 25C but if you but 800 you get it at 12c each. hmmm.
