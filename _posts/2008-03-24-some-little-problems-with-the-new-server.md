Ok. there be some problems with the server, but nothing major. its just stuff like images missing. i am keeping my eye on the server to see what is going on, and nothing major is wrong. if i get a chance i will get it working on the other machine (Duron 700 with 256mb ram) and will run the SQL Server else where, to make speed improvments. anyway, alls well so far!
