Looks like we are getting close to getting [Windows Vista booting on an iMac Core Duo][1]! This would definatly be cool! now, if it works, and you can dual boot between OSX and Vista, i would be extreamly happy and wanting an iMac very soon! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
