[Tornado Cache &#8211; Open Content Network Edition][1]. this is something simular to [freecache][2], but is based on java, and requires the user to have Java 1.3 or heigher and the Java Web Start 1.0 or heigher installed. that will then download the tornado cache plugin and start the download of a file. interesting idea. i have to try this out. now what do i distribute thats bigger then java and tornado&#8230;
