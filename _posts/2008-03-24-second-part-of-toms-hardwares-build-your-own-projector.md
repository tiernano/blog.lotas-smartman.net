[this article over at Toms Hardware][1] goes into a few more details about building your own Projector. I last posted about this [last month][2]. Looks like fun. now all i need is a spare flat panel monitor and a Overhead projector, and of cource, enough wall space! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
