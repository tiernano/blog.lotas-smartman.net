a couple of days back (Monday actually) i bit the bullet and bought an MSI Wind / Advent 4211. They are basically the same device, just rebadged&#8230; This is now my Third mini laptop in 9 months or so. First, there was the [Asus EEE][1], which i had for a couple of months, before selling and buying an [OQO][2]. I swaped that a couple weeks back for a [HTC TyTN II][3], which left me mini laptopless&#8230; So, the Advent 4211 came to the resque! this so far is perfect! I have not gotten a chance to get it to talk to the Wifi in work (have to get it to join the domain first, which will envolve installing XP Pro, which i havent had a chance to do just yet) but it connects nicley to the internet with my [Nokia N95][4]. I have walked around the building a few times, talking with different people, with the machine in my hand. when someone mentions something i need to lookup info about, its a matter of cracking the laptop, telling to connect to the web though dialup networking on the N95 and away i go! its doesent take too long either. couple of seconds to go from sleep to working, few seconds to connect to dialup networking, and its all good.

speaking of which, i was showing one of the lads the laptop the other day, and he was surfing around, connected via 3G. oen of the pages he visited was YouTube. he started watching a video, and i then mentioned it to other of the other lads that it was connected though the phone. he handed me the laptop, showing me the streaming video. flawless! pretty damn impressive! so, the moment youve all been waiting for: photos! click the link to see the rest of the set. some are a little blury&#8230; taken with the N95, i think the focus was slightly off&#8230;
