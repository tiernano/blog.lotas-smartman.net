[Slashdot | O&#8217;Reilly Pushing Founder&#8217;s Copyright System][1]. Interesting. i like reading books, especially electronic ones. now i have my palm top and phone, both can read ebooks! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> The openbooks project is [here][2] and theres a pretty cool book [here: The Cathedral and the Bazaar][3]. I read this a while back, and its a great book, especially if your into GNU/Linux, and opensource, free software foundation, etc.
