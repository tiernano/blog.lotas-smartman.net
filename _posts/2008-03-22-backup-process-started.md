Wahoo! i have just started the backup process. i burned a CD full of MP3s and stuff, and now im backing up files with backup thats included with win2k. first time using it. so this is going to take a while and then im going to format and reinstall win2k. i just hope it works. Or will i install windows XP? hmmmm. i have the pre service pack version here, and i may check it out again. Well, the next time you see a post, it will be from a new, clean system. hehe!
