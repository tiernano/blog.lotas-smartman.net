I have been thinking about something like this for a while now. basically what i want is a large file server sitting in my comms closet with a terabyte or so (maybe 2, their small) of hard drive space (for those of you who think im mad, 2 Tb of raid 5 storage can be gotten with just 5 500Gb hdds, and a raid 5 controler for about 2 grand, or 1EUR per GB&#8230;, or that can be upgraded to 8 500Gb hdds, which is 4Tb of real storage or 3Tb of RAID 5 storage, for about 3 grand&#8230; SWEET). 

Anyway, back to the point of this post. I have been thinking of having the large storage server just holding films and recorded content i want to keep from the media center. the problem i had was trying to get the media&nbsp;encoded, and now with the XBox 360, in a format that would play on it. Well, [check out this tutorial on how to convert a DVD to a WMV with 5.1&nbsp;sound][1]. very cool. i have to try this soon&#8230;&nbsp;Sorry for the rant. im a bit tired&#8230;
