[Pay-as-you-go motoring just around the corner][1]. *The European Space Agency (ESA) is funding Irish provider of location technology products Mapflow to undertake a feasibility study to look into the possibility of implementing a pan-European road tolling system.* cool, i think. though it will make it easer for roads to be tolled, so thats bad. hmmm.
