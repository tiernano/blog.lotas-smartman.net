[the register has a review of the P900][1]. this phone looks really sweet. im looking at one of these or the P800, or a 3650. a friend in fas got the 3650 and the buttons are quite weird, but the 16mb more memory over the 7650 is quite cool. i may wait till the [3660][2] is released here as it has a proper keypad like normal phones.
