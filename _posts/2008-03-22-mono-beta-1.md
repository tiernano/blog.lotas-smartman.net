[Mono Beta 1][1] has been released! it says there support for MacOS X, but no download for it yet. i want to try mono and find out how good it is when porting apps from windows to other platforms. also, i want to see if its posible to run an XML web service on a linux/mac osx box when its written in VB or C#.
