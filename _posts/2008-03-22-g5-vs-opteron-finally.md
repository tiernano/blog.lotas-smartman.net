[g5 Vs Opteron!][1]. [[Slashdot][2]] Looks quite cool. the G5 wins in a lot of results, but the major thing about both these chips is what OS&#8217;s are fully compatible. i know linux has been 64-Bit enabled since the dawn of time (nearly, or a while now anyway) but a 64 bit version of mac OSX is not due for a while, windows wont have a proper 64 bit edition for a while as-well, so are the results all that good? are these definite?
