So, the MSDN event yesterday was pretty cool. unfortunitly, i dont have a lot of time to tell you a lot about it, but it was pretty cool. lots of demos on ASP.NET 2.0, which looks really sweet, and talk about the .NET future, etc. I got some photos so i will post them eventually. I will blog about that later. anyway, back to work. talk to you then.
