Luckily, this would not apply to me, since as Zeldman is fond of repeatedly

pointing out, <q>dive into mark</q> already sounds vaguely homoerotic. Which

leads me to&#8230;

    There are two kinds of homophobia, at least in Texas. The first is a

  <p>
    hatred of all things homosexual. That&#8217;s bad. The other involves a certain

SodomyLaws.org says that 14 states have</p> 

sodomy laws</a>. Some states (like

[Texas][1]) only ban

sodomy between homosexuals; others (like

North</p> 

Carolina</a>) ban it altogether. Many states lump it in with bestiality

(although Texas does not). North Carolina has banned sodomy

[since 1749][2]

(it was punishable by death until 1868).

Anal sex can be a</p> 

perfectly safe activity</a> as long as you take the necessary precautions.

SodomyLaws.org also has an extensive page on

the history of this</p> 

landmark Lawrence case</a>, all the way back to 1998 when it started.

The Supreme Court is expected to rule in July.
