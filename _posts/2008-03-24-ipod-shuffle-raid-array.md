First there was the [the floppy raid array][1], and now someone has created an [iPod Shuffle RAID array][2]. 4Gb of Flash based storage for about 600EUR. Not really worth it with external cases being fairly cheap and same with hard drives (In theory you could get 4 200Gb hdds for 100EUR each, and 4 External USB Cases for about 40EUR each and still have enough for a USB hub!) Still, its fun to have&#8230;
