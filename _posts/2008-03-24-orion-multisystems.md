[Orion Multisystems][1] have 2 interesting products. they have the DT-12, which is a 12 note (processor) Desktop cluster, running linux. it supports 12 processors, 24gb of ram and 1Tb of hard drive space. they also have the DS-96. this thing has up to 96 processors, up to 192Gb ram and up to 9.6Tb storage. they both use Transmeta Efficeon chips, starting at 1.4Gz. boot time for the DS-96 is 2min! very interesting. [the inquirer][2] say its about $100,000 for the DS96. wont be getting one of those any time soon. wonder are they clusterable?
