I have been thinking about this DRM Free iTunes idea for a few days now (this is the third post, <a class href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/archive/2007/04/02/itunes-and-emi-drm-free-but-a-little-more-expencive.aspx">1</a> and <a class href="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/archive/2007/04/04/drm-free-itunes-thoughs.aspx">2</a> are here) and i missed something: Albums will be priced the same, even though they are DRM Free. This nows means that if you are going to buy an album, and its available in 2 versions, DRM crippled at 128kb/s, or DRM Free with 2x the quality, why on earth would you pay for the crippled version? Its crippled in 2 ways: not as good quality, and DRM enabled. the mind boggles on that.

Secondly, What devices will support AAC. Well, the <a class href="http://www.zune.net/en-us/meetzune/techspecs/player.htm">Zune does</a>, which is nice. The <a class href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/04/25/psp-firmware-2-7-released-in-japan/">PSP also supports AAC</a>, and the <a class href="http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=pocket+pc+AAC&src=IE-SearchBox">Pocket PC will play it too</a>. Ohh, and if i remember correctly, the <a class href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/systemuse/xbox360/digitalmedia/ipod.htm">XBox 360 will play AAC Files</a>&#8230;
