TUAW is saying that apple have [stoped taking bulk orders of the mac mini][1]. Is this because they are releasing a new intel powered mac mini next Week (press event on the 28th). Could a nice little intel powered mac mini (more then likly a single core chip, doubt apple will stick a dual core chip in something so small and cheap, unless they have it as a $+ option) be my next mac machine? I have already ordered a new workstation/media center/server system (more details later&#8230;) but this would be nice as a test bed for playing with stuff (and if it can run Vista, even better!)
