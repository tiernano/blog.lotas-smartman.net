Now this is cool: [A home made bottel cap tripod][1]! very handy stuff. I have been trying to take proper photos of me for the site (see the new logo above, that was done with my camera, a chair, a coffee table and an upturned dust bin, which strangly enough all worked without falling over!). Anyway, very cool stuff!
