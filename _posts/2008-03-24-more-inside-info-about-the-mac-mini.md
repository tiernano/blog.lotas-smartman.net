[The unofficial apple weblog has a little bit of info about the mac mini][1]. Basicially, its got a (Motorola) FreeScale processor (7447, the one they had was a 1.42Gz model) and takes a laptop hard drive. so, thats not a major problem for me, but i did want to know that. Hmmm. i might shell out the extra 100 EURO for the 80Gb model, but i havent decided yet. the old mac will now definatly be getting the 80gb ripped out of it and it will go into a server of some sort&#8230;
