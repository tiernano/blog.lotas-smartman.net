[this slashdot article][1] says that the terascale cluster, known as bigmac, is running @ 14TFlops with only 128 of the 1100 nodes. it is reckoned that if it does keep up with that speed, it will be number 2 on the top 500. not bad for a 5.2million doller super computer! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
