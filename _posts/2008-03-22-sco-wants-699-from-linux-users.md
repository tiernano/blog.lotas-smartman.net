[SCO wants $699 from Linux Users][1] and after October 15th, 2003 they want $1399. now what they WANT and what they GET are 2 different things. how about the finger? Hmmmm. I know they [already got a lawsuit from Redhat][2] and [are not too happy][3] (disappointed even!) with it, but they are not getting money off me. Abuse maybe, but definatly not money. wonder what [google][4] would have to pay since their whole network is run on linux. and is that per copy of linux?
