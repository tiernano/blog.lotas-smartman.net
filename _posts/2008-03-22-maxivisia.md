Hmmmm. just found [MaxiVista][1]. This looks fairly cool. basicly, you can have 2 machines and run this on both of them. one acts as a server, the other as a viewer. the viewer becomes a secondary monitor for the server. so insted of needing a dual headed graphics card, you just get this. has some flaws. you need 2 pcs though! and only runs on windows ATM. they are working on a mac copy, but will only be usefull if i can use a windows client and a mac server.
