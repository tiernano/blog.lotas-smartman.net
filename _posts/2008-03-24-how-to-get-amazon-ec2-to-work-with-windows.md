Well, how to get the tools to work with Windows anyway. [ArbFranklin has a post explaining all you need to know][1]. I have had an [EC2][2] account with amazon for a while now, but never got it working. this should be interesting though. i have to try it out. As a second point, [Enomaly has an article showing you][3] how to run Windows Server on an EC2 instance. they use [QEMU][4] to do emulation, and you may have to use a linux box to do the building of images, etc, but, if it works, and works properly, this is sweet! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
