[AnandTech has this article: Linux and EM64T; Intel&#8217;s 64-bit Suggestion][1]. they test an athlon 64 at 2.2Gz and an intel Xeon at 3.6Gz. they tested under linux, and the results are cool. the xeon at over 60% faster clock speed is slower in a lot of tests! makes me want to get a dual opteron as my next major workstation. i was contimplating a dual xeon, but opteron, sweet&#8230;.
