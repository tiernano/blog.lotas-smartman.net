Well, the [Mac Pro][1] arrived today, and its up and running, and this is the first post. it might be a while before i get photos of it up, but it could be a lot sooner then expected. this thing is FAST! currently, i am installing [Office 2004 for the Mac][2], getting [iTunes][3] setup with all my songs (from a different machine, so its only limited by network speed) and also getting [Aperture][4] setup from my iPod (importing about 3000+ photos from my iPod Vault). and during all this, the processors are 95% idle! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> This rocks!
