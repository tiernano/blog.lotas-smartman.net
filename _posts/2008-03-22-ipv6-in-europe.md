[the register is reporting][1] that Brussels is getting upto speed with IPv6. this should be a good thing. i think my router doesent like this much since i cant get it working yet, but i have a machine somewhere spare that *could* act as a router, i hope, and i have have 2 on the network, the computer up front and then the router its self in the back somewhere. that way i can get IPv6 running on parts of the network, and not on other parts. ill try this later. have a few other things to do first.
