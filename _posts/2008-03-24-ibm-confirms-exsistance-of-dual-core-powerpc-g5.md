Looks like IBM has outed the Dual Core PowerPC G5 processor. [The  
register is reporting][1] that an advisory on IBMs site talks about the chip.  
That would be cool if apple does release a [Dual-Dual  
processor system][2]. It would be sweet. Just think: Dual-Dual core, 3Gz system  
with 16Gb ram and more hard drives then you can shake a stick at&#8230;  
\*drool\*
