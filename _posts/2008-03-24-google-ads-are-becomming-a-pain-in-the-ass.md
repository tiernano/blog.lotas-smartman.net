I use google ads on my site, because i though there was going to be some intelligance to it. The thinking on my part is that if i am talking about a Nokia Phone, there would be an ad on my site about Nokia Phones, or some sort of phone. And for a while it did work. and then someone in google **fixed** something and now im getting Ads about blogging and RSS feeds. Who would be reading my blog and looking to start there own? not a lot of people, i can tell you. There is a feature in Google Adsense that allows you to remove a competetors URL from your site. but what i want is a feature to remove a specific keyword (in my case RSS, blog, blogging, and a few others) from my ads. How hard, in theory, can this be?
