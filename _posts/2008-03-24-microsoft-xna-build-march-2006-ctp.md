[The March 06 CTP of XNA Build has been released][1]. This allows you to do some interesting stuff, and to show off, the Microsoft Game Studios has released the source code to [Microsoft MechCommander 2 as a shared code release][2]. This can be built with the help of Visual C++ 2005 and the XNA Build tools. Brian Keller, Product Manager for XNA [has info on his blog here][3]. System Requirements for the Build are:

<ul>

    <b>Supported Operating Systems: </b>Windows XP Service Pack 2
  </li>
</ul></div> 

<p>
  Microsoft Visual C++ 2005<br />Microsoft MSBuild 2.0<br />4.5 GB of disk space is required during installation.
</p>

  I am wondering does this work on Vista&nbsp;/ 2003 Server / 64 bit OS? I want to try this on the dual opteron box to see how long it takes to build, but that has Vista, ATM, so we will see&#8230;
