The constant promise of another day&#8230;.

[Railheaddesign][1] fuels more anticipation with the following:

Tomorrow promises to be a &#8216;big&#8217; day for Apple, so get your credit card balances down and your paychecks deposited&#65533;

Unfortunately, by this point, there has been very little concrete evidence of the anticipated 20th anniversary updates&#8230; Uncharacteristically, Apple has let the date come-and-go without any acknowledgement .

The only remaining evidence is plans for Apple Store floorplan changes this week&#8230;
