Im looking at getting myself one of [these][1]. Its an [MSI Bluetooth Key USB][1]. Very handy for me. See my [phone][2] is bluetooth enabled, and i would like to be able to send photos direct to the PC, not though email. its costing me money to do that!!! also sending apps, images, etc to the phone, will be cheaper though bluetooth. at the moment i email the stuff to my self and then download it from the net. costs a bit of money!! So with this its cool. Look forward to more photos of weird and wonderfull stuff! maybe ill start a [photo blog][3]? Note to self. [this forum thred][4] has info on making the bluetooth key work properly!
