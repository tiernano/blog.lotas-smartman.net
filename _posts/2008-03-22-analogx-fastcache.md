[AnalogX][1] has some pretty sweet software on the site. but one of the coolest ones i have seen so far is [FastCache][2]. its a DNS server for your local machine. it sits in between your DNS server on the internet and your web browser. when you visit your webpages, depending on how your current network is set up, it may take some time to resolve ip addresses. this speeds that up. i just installed it a few minutes ago and its already saving me time, and the net is now a lot faster. have to install it at home though. i surf more at home and it would be nice to speed that up!
