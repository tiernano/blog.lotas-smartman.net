ok. computer is working. i think. the motherboard is reporting the chips are running at 100Deg C each. but my board doesent have a built in temp monitor. its in the CPU. so i think its getting a wrong reading. i hope!!! My bios says about 50 &#8211; 55C. still hot, but not as bad as it was (80 -90 under the bios). added a 400W power supply and a few new fans. lets hope it stays good.
