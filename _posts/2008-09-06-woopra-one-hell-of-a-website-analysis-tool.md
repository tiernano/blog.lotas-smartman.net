So, i finally got accepted into the [Woopra][1] BETA pool, and man this thing rocks! For those who dont know, Woopra is a real time web analysis system. it has some really cool features, including a nice desktop client for watching your sites. the idea is quite simple: add a small peice of tracking code to the bottom of your webpages, and watch the live analysis go by! the beta is kind of limited. takes a while to get in, but well worth it!
