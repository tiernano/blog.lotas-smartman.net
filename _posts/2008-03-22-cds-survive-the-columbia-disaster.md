[this article][1] says that 3 cds survived the collumbia disaster. 2 deep Purple and a Rainbow Cd survived and the where found in the debris.  


> Astronaut Kalpana Chawla was a fan of the band and took three CDs into space: Deep Purple&#8217;s &#8220;Machine Head&#8221; and &#8220;Down To Earth,&#8221; and Rainbow&#8217;s &#8220;Purpendicular.&#8221; She also sent the band several e-mails while in space. The band was working on their &#8220;Bananas&#8221; album when the shuttle broke up on re-entry last February. 
> 
> The discs were found in the debris, and Chawla&#8217;s husband gave them back to the band during their Mexico City concert in September. The band plan to give the &#8220;Machine Head&#8221; and &#8220;Down To Earth&#8221; CDs to the Rock Hall, but keep the &#8220;Purpendicular&#8221; one as a personal memento, since two members of Rainbow are in the current lineup of Deep Purple. 
> 
> Within an hour of hearing about the shuttle, guitarist Steve Morse wrote a song called &#8220;Contact Lost,&#8221; which appears on the &#8220;Bananas&#8221; album. 
> 
> He plans to donate the royalties to the families of the astronauts.</blockquote>
