Right. lets say you buy a PC with a copy of XP on it and you only want the PC for linux. well check out [this howto][1] on [Linux Journal][2] and see how! handy. might try it with dell. i dont exactly want to buy a copy of winxp for a laptop. they sell &#8220;naked&#8221; (computer with no OS) servers but not PC&#8217;s or Laptops. This may help.
