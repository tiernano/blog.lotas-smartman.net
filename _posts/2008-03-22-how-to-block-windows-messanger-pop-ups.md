[this article over at oriellynet][1] shows you how to stop them pop-ups that are comming from spammers. you may have gotten these before. its a message from someone outside your network (if you have one) sending stupid things like &#8220;pay us to stop these&#8221; or something like that. anyway, this article shows you how to do it without paying them. my firewall blocks these, so i dont know what they look like, but the article is interesting. looks like windows xp only.
