Ok, this is probably the [coolest remote control][1] i have ever seen! I want one of those! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Only a few questions: Will it control other devices (TV, Amp, XBox360?) does it have a docking station for charging? (bottom of it looks like it has, but unknown if it does).
