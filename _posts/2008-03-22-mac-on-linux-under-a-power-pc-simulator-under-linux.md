Right. im having an idea, and have had this for a while now. [this is a powerPC Sumulator][1] that will simulate an IBM PowerPC 750 and a Motorola PowerPC 7450. actually, thats not the one i was thinking about, but there is one that will run Linux PowerPC software under an i386 under linux. now, [MacOnLinux][2] is an app for running Mac OS 7.5.2 &#8211; 10.x under linux on a powerPC system. now, my idea is that you get the simulator to run mac on linux, which then runs mac os. im going to try it later on sometime. and ill report on if it works, but in theory it should, shouldent it?
