[Russell wants americans to send SMSages to other americans!][1] This makes sence. he says that billions of text messages where sent over the new year. im not suprised. i send about 200 on christmas day alone, and should have sent about the same on new years but had no signal. <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> anyway, interesting read.
