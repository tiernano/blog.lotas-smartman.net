[I complained about blogspam][1] before and now [the solution is here][2]! i have to install this. should be handy. i only get a few comments to the blog, but the ones linking to other pages like camera sites or something stupid like that are rediculis. i have removed about 5 or 6 of these, but its a pain to do so. the only way to get them removed from the site is do a rebuild of the pages. that takes a while and load on the server increases. so thats not something i like doing.
