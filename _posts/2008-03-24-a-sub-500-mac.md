and i am not talking second hard either! [Think Secret are speculating][1] a release of a sub $500 mac ($499 to be correct) without a monitor. they say it could be announced on Jan 11 at the MacWorld Expo. this could be cool, if true. Last year i was [posting about a eMac 2, which would have dual processors][2]. neadless to say, i, and the original poster, was wrong. if this is true though, it could be interesting. i have an aging 333Mhz G3 iMac sitting on my desk, and i would like to get a new one, just to play with. the only reason i havent done a lot more with my imac is the lack of speed. it takes 20 seconds just to load safari! so this would be handy if it works out.
