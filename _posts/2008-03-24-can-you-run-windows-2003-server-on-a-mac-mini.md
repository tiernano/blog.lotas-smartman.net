Theres an interesting question for you. is it posible to run Windows 2003  
Server on a mac mini? Why would you want to? Well, size for one. the thing is  
tiny! and power for 2: uses very small amounts of power, and can have 2 cores  
running in the system.*&nbsp;*im wondering this because if its posible, i  
will be looking for a few of these for stuff. [update] [looks like it is posible][1]!  
<img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> wahoo! and [more  
here][2].so your talking a little under a grand (roughly €945 for the core solo  
with 2Gb ram, after market) or a&nbsp;bit over a grand (€1175, for the core duo  
with 2Gb ram). Very cool stuff&#8230;
