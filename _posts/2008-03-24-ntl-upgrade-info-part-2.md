NTL will be upgrading their connections on March 14th in the UK, and info about it is [here][1]. Their 300k/s connection gets upgraded to 1mb/s, but the cap goes down to 3Gb a month, down from 30gb. The 750k and 1.5mb get upgraded to 2mb/s and 3mb/s respectivly. they keep their current 30Gb a month limit. I also rang NTL Ireland and asked what the deal here was. it will happen, but it wont be for 2-3 months. Pretty cool though. download speeds will be upgraded from 180k/s to about 360k/s, and i am still thinking about getting the second line in! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
