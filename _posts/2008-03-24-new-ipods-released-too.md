Not only did we get podcasting support in iTunes, but Apple has also released 2 new iPods. gone are the original iPods with black and white displays, and gone are the special photo edition iPods with color displays. now they are one and called the [iPod color][1]. 20 and 60Gb models available, starting at $299 for the 20Gb and $399 for the 60Gb model. also, apple has a [podcasting page][2] on their site. just basic info there, but there is a link to a page, which at the moment doesent exist (damn 404 errors) entitled [Create your own podcasts with GarageBand and iLife 05][3], which could be interesting when it does exist&#8230;
