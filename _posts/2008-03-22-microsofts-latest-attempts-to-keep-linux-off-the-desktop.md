[linux world][1] talks about how 2 companies in austriala are making there sites and services windows and mac only. its not new. my ISP, [NTL][2], dont even support windows 2000 or XP! they support windows 95 and 98. they also support the mac. linux is definatly out of the question. you then have to look the other way too: how many mac apps, like itunes, would you like to see on windows? i know they are making it for windows, but its still a mac app till then.
