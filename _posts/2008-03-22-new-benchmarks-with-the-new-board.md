Ok. i had some benchmarks [here][1] of my Athlon 1.33Gz with the old board and 1Gb of memory. here are the same tests done with the new board, same chip and ram. AND ITS FASTER!! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> i was running an FTP Client in the background so the memory might be off slighly, but its still faster! Wahoo! go me! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> here are the results in jpg format.
