[Digital minds.com.br has this small page on how to podcast on windows xp][1]. now thats cool! I will try and see if my laptop has a microphone, which i am not sure if it does. it probably does, but i dont know as i said. i never tried it. anyway, if it works, i will try a little podcast tonight and, if my internet connection is up tongiht, i will post it tonight, but if not, i will try and post it tomorrow. i dont know what it will sound like, and i dont know when it will be up, and i dont even know what i will be talking about, but, anyway. sorry about the no post yesterday, i forgot to post and my internet connection is not back yet. anyway, more later.
