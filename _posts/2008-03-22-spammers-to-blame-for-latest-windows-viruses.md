[this slashdot article][1] talks about how the latest virus W32/Mimail-E, is to blame for attacks on [Spamhaus][2], [Spamcop][3] and [Spwes][4]. BASTARDS! damn spammers should die. why dont they bring the death penelty in for spamming? it would be one way to stop them! they attack my email server with junk, which is just deleted, and they also attack my blog with junk, which is also deleted! why cant we just delete them?
