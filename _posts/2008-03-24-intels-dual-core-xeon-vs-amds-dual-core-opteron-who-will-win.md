Well, AMD seems to be the answer! GamePC has a review and benchmark tests of the [New Xeon Dual Core (Paxville)][1]. they test the dual xeon with dual cores agenst a dual opteron with dual cores, and the opteron wins, hands down! witch makes me happy i decided to have dual core dual opterons in my new workstation!
