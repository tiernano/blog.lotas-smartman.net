[the apple WWDC][1] is starting on Monday. So, i havent heard a lot of what people reckon Jobs will release. [think secret are saying yes to new displays and no to new imacs][2]. [the mac news network forums members have their say here][3]. one thing we have been nearly garenteed they will not release is the 3Gz G5 since they released the 2.5Gz a while back, and they probably wont release a new G5 powerbook since they released new ones a while back too. one thing we are garenteed is info about Tiger. Apples new OS. Mac OSX10.4. i cant wait to see whats released. watch and wait!
