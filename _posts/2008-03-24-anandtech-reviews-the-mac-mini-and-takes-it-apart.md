check out this [anandtech article][1] about the mac mini. they play around with it (it is a 2.5&#8243; hdd in it, and its the 5400RPM model. also, the one they got had a 400~Mhz DDR dimm, not the 333Mhz memory apple said). They also take it apart and show photos of the inside. Found out yesterday too, and ment to post it but dident, [that apple has dropped prices of upgrades for it too][2]. 1Gb upgrade is down $100 to $325. you could probably get it cheaper elsewhere, but if you do it voids your warrenty. Anyway, back to the anandtech article. very interesting read. goes in to lots of details. 18 pages in total. Well worth the read.
