Earlier on in the week i had a link to the&nbsp;Nerd Vittles blog which had 3 articles, [linked to here][1], on how to set your mac mini up as an ISP in a box. Well, there is a now a 4th article [here on how to setup PHP][2], but reading back on&nbsp;the site, there is also some other interesting things that they have done with the mac mini: <a title="Permanent Link: The Ultimate Home Automation Server: Your Shiny, New $500 Mac Mini" href="http://mundy.org/blog/index.php?p=14" rel=bookmark>The Ultimate Home Automation Server: Your Shiny, New $500 Mac Mini</a>, [Ultimate Home Automation Server: The $500 Mac Mini, Part II][3], [Ultimate Home Automation Server: The $500 Mac Mini, Part III</font>][4]&nbsp;and [Ultimate Computer Telephony Server: The $500 Mac mini][5]. cool articles!
