Ok, so it&#8217;s not the most challenging thing in the world. You just scan your CD cover (LP if you&#8217;re as old as me) and bam! you&#8217;ve got your favourite artwork right there in iTunes. But I&#8217;m a lazy software guy (it&#8217;s an advantage, honestly) so when I got Sofa on the latest MacAddict CD I was hooked on letting this neat little tool do the work for me. [[O&#8217;Reilly MacDevCenter.com][1]] i was wondering when there would be something like this for itunes. windows media player has it, and i was surprised that itunes dident. anyway, going to take a look at this. sounds good.

Ok. i should really post links properly on these posts. here it is a little over 7 months after the first post! [Sofa + iTunes = Lazy man&#8217;s album covers!][2]
