[Virtual PC for Mac Delayed][1]. When it is released, it will have G5 support. wonder where they reckon the G5 emulating a x86 will be ranked when it comes to speed. Like, whats the equivilant when tested agenst an x86? One thing i want to see microsoft release is SMP support in VM&#8217;s. Like, either getting a dual processor system to be seen as one processor (maybe with HT?) by the VM, or the VM seeing both processors. i know this is probably Virtual Server only territory, but it would be a sweet thing for developers. i know i would like it. Ohhh, and that on either a Dual x86, Dual PowerPC, or even Dual 64bit AMD or Intel.
