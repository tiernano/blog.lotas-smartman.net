Extream Tech has a [review of intels new Dual Core Pentium][1]. Some interesting results. they benchmark it agenst a P4 EE 3.73Gz on 2 different chipsets (Intel 955X and an intel 925X) and the results for the Dual core system are not impressive for some of the benchmarks agenst the 3.73Gz system, but, its still interesting. now a dual dual core system would be sweet. wonder will it be AMD or Intel, or even Apple who come out first with that&#8230;
