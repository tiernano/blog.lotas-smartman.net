Now this is cool! [Anandtech has info on the new Pentium D and Pentium Extream][1] which is basicly the P4 with Dual cores and the P4 Extream with Dual Cores. The Pentium Extream will have a 1066Mhz FSB and Hyperthreadding (4 threads total), and the Pentium D will have 2 cores, No HT and 1mb cache per core. Wonder what the Xeon will have when released&#8230;.
