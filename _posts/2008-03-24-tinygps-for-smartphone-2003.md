I just found [TinyGPS for the windows mobile 2003 smartphone edition.][1]. sounds interesting, but it seems to have crashed my smartphone 2. not totally sure if it has or not though. my sim is a bit old (a bout 5 years old!) and thats causing problems with the smartphone cause it cant read it well. anyway, this software watches cell ids of the GSM towers your connected to and works out where you sre from them. its very basic, but it works well. well i had something simular on the Nokia 7650 which worked well. nope. it seems to have killed my phone. ARSE! Hmmm. ok. try at your own risk! [update] yea. it totally killed my phone. hard reset was what was needed. dont try this at home kids!!!
