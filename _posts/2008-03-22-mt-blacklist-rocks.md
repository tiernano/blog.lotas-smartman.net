I have been using [MT Blacklist][1] now for about 2 weeks and so far it has blocked over 30 peices of blog spam! The idea of getting new links from a centrilized place is quite handy. also, when i get an email telling me i have gotten a comment, if it is spam, its dead with a simple click though. handy. anyway, if you run a weblog, check it out.
