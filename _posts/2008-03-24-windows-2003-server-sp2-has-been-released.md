Mr Bink <a class href="http://bink.nu/Article9703.bink">has all the details</a>, and here is a list of the OS&#8217;s that are updated:

&nbsp;•&nbsp; Windows Server 2003 with SP2   
&nbsp;  
•&nbsp; Windows Server 2003 R2 with SP2   
&nbsp;  
•&nbsp; Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions with SP2   
&nbsp;  
•&nbsp; Windows Server 2003 R2 x64 Editions with SP2   
&nbsp;  
•&nbsp; Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems with SP2   
&nbsp;  
•&nbsp; Windows XP Professional x64 Edition with SP2&nbsp;

&nbsp;some may be suprised to see Windows XP Pro x64 edition up there, but thats correct. XP x64 is based around a 2003 server core,&nbsp;because of its 64bitness.
