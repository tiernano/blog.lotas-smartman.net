Check out this oreilly article showing you how to use [bit torrent to distribute large files over the web][1]. very handy stuff. if there was an automated way of doing this, it would be sweet. i probably need a little more upload bandwidth to try this out fully, or at least get HTTP traffic to be more important then bit torrent traffic on the network, but quite cool none the less!
