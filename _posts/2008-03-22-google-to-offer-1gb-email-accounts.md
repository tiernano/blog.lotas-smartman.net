not sure if this is an april fools joke or what, but if it is then loads of news papers are not going to be happy tomorrow. <a href=\"http://slashdot.org/articles/04/04/01/0038200.shtml?tid=126&tid=95\">slashdot are reporting that google</a> are to offer a 1gb email service. store upto 1gb in your email account. <a href=\"http://news.com.com/2100-1032_3-5182805.html\">CNet has more</a>. the reason news papers could be unhappy with this is simple. the AP are talking about it <a href=\"http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/G/GOOGLE\_E\_MAIL?SITE=APWEB&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CA\_GOOGLE\_E\_MAIL\_CAOL-?SITE=APWEB&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT\">here</a> and if this is a joke, then they wont be happy! nice if it where to happen though.
