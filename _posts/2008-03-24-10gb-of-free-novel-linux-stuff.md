[novel are offering 10Gb of DVDs and CDS][1] for free for you to try linux. theres a copy of Suse 9.1 Pro on DVD, 8 standard server, and a lot more. I remember Microsoft had an Agile Servers package. it came with copies of windows 2000 server and pro, exchange, ISA, SQL, and pretty much every other microsoft server available at the time. i think it was either a 1 year license or 180 day license for testing, but there where something like 5 licenses for 2k server, and a lot of exchange and win2k pro and it was just one amazing pack. 20 cds or something and that included documentation and stuff. i learned a lot with that. wonder will they do sometime like that again for 2k3 server&#8230;
