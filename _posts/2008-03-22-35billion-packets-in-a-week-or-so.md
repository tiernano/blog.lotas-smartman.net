Ok. I just took [this screen shot][1] (warning! 200+k in size and 1280*1024 pixels) from my server and workstation. Im connecting over Remote Desktop and seen that the amount of packets sent and recived on one of my LAN cards was a total of 3.5Billion! 2.05 billion recived and 1.4 billion sent. then theres an other net card that has sent 4.1million and recived 3.8 million. my net card on my workstation has sent 2.78million and recived 4.06million. and this is in 8days! A bit mad i though. its a lot of internal traffic anyway because my router is reporting 6.4million out and 7.1million out. now to find out why so many packets are being sent!
