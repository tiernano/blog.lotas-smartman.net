Right. just installed a copy of windows XP on my machine. i split my /home dir under linux (which was 84gb in total) in 2. one 40Gb partition for windows, and the other that hasent been mounted for my /home dir under linux. i wanted this for use as a tv recorder since linux wasent playing fully. i should get it running soon, buy while its not playing, im using windows to testing. so this works great! im watching TV now and blogging, which is handy!
