AMD Opteron Chips will be powering 2 beowulf clusters at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), accouding to [this article][1]. The big one, known as Lighting, will be packing 2800 Opteron chips in a design built by [LinuxNetworx][2]. this will have a peak speed of 11.2Tera flops. Cool! the littler one, orange, will have 512 processors. Pretty cool!!!
