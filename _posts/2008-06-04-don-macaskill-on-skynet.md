Don MacAskill over at SmugMug has a post talking about [SmugMug&#8217;s SkyNet][1], their EC2 and Amazon S3 based system for image processing. Its a very interesting and informitive post, and its something that has had me thinking all day. I dont have a need for that much processing power, and even if i did, i have a lot in my house as i speak, but its an interesting read if you have any need for masive distributed computing&#8230;
