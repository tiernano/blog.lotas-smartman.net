Slashdot are reporting that if you live in some cities in France, you can get a wopping [2.5Gb/s internet connection!][1] The connection is 2.5Gb down and 1.2Gb/s up. Its a fiber connection, and my next question (the first was, can i move to France?) is what is the bandwidth cap? My guess? 100Gb or so&#8230; stupid bandwidth caps&#8230;&nbsp;
