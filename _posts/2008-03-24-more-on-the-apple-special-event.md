Just watching the apple special event, and, well, i have seen the new iMac (hmmm, not totally impressed&#8230;) and the front row (definatly not impressed). its very media center edition-ish, with only half (or less) of the features. no TV, no internet stuff (well, the movie trailer is internet, but thats not lots of video), no buying music over MSN (or the other internet services). its just not media center. even the starting sound for &#8220;front row&#8221; is very media center-ish! they show a photo of 2 windows media center remotes and the apple remote. 6 on the apple, over 40 (with a lot more features) on the media center. and they made a cock-up on their slids. 160 and 250MB (MB!) hard drives! hah! anyway, more later if i get a chance.
