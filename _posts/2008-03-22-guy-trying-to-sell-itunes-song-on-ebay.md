[this guy is trying][1] to sell a song he bought on itunes, for 0.99c, on ebay. i just checked and there are a total of 69 bids and its up at $350! pretty mad.  
**[update]** as of 20030904 @ 08:48, the price is $16,600! the money is going to the [EFF][2], and the ebay link is [here][3]!!! 16 grand for a 99cent song! FFS! Thats cool though. the EFF will get a lot of money, if it is really sold at that price!
