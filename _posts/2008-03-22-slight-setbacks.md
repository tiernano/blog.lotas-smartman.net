Ok. theres a few set backs on my road to getting the dual processor system of my dreams. Firslty, i owe money to people. [Zone edit][1] told me i own them money. my site recived over 1million DNS queries and i need to pay for them. In one way its bad cause i owe money, but then again, im getting loads of hits! Wahoo! Also i still owe money from the Bluetooth key i bought last week. so i reckon add 2 weeks before i get the board. <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />
