2 interesting videos up on channel 9 at the moment: [A First look at Exchange 12][1] is exactly what it says on the tin. i use Exchange a LOT. My work email is Exchange (which is kind of expected as I work for MS) and my home mail server is also exchange. I would actually concider installing Exchange 12 on my home box for playing with. The other interesting video is the [Coding4Fun video][2]. I am currently watching the exchange one, and will eventually watch the Coding4Fun video. so, cant comment on them, but cool!
