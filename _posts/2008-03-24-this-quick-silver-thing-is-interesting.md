So, i heard [Russell talking about Quick Silver][1], and Tiger, on the Mac, and i though i have to try that. And, its interesting&#8230; the idea behind it is nice. i hit control space and you start typing in stuff. very cool. i like this. i like the idea of hitting control space and typing in pause to pause itunes. i also like ctrl-space play. currently in the middle of listening to a podcast so i havent tried a lot of other itunes commands, but it is sweet. there is a next song function too. now all i need is a ctrl-space post to blog, with a text window that i just type stuff and it auto posts. that would be nice! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Now when will this arrive on windows?
