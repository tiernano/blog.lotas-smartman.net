Ok! Linux is now being installed on my machine. [Redhat 9.0][1] is the distribution i have chosen because im too lazy to let [gentoo][2] loose on my machine for a while anyway. It will take a few hours for gentoo to work and involve me actually being there telling it what to do. handy in some ways, but i think ill wait till i get my dual athlons before i build it again. im currently at 31% and have about 5 hours left before its fully working. actually using the server now. lynx is weird for writing posts for blogs on! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> im on the server but connected though the workstation. i found SSH on it. handy. anyway, going to be. this should be complete by the time i get up in the morning. ill post when i get to work.
