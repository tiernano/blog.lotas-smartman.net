this time last year, the 7/7/2005, i got my job offer for Microsoft Ireland. it was also a tragic day in London with the bombings. not a lot else to talk about, other then that, but i am currently stuck in Dublin Airport, connecting to a Wifi connection, that is not free, but fairly fast, and delayed due to a [bomb scare eairler on today][1]. bit pissed off with the whole delayed and the way it was handled. checked in on time, actually, nearly 2 hours before the final check in time, was told nothing there, and then 5 min before the actual bording time, we realized that the flight was set to delaied. ahhh well, at least i have internet access&#8230;
