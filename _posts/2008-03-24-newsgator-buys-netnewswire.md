[NewsGator has bought NetNewsWire][1] (or [Ranchero][2], the company who makes NetNewsWire). this is interesting news because if the NewsGator service is added to NetNewsWire, i can have my feeds all in sync on all my machines (the Outlook Client on my Laptop, feed deamon on my workstation, Media center edition on my Media center, on my Mobile and PDA, and then on other machines with the web client). Very cool stuff!
