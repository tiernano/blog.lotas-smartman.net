One of the things i have always wanted to do if i ever release an application is the Auto update feature. I have though about doing this for a while, but never implimented it. Well [Scott Hanselman][1] [explains what you should do to impliment this][2]. the first option is interesting, but the second 2 (XML backend to tell you app info, and also the app updating its self) is the kind of things i want to build. now all i need is an app that i can release to the web&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
