So, for the last week or so, i have been pretty much exclusively running OSX on the Mac Pro. I did have [VMWare][1] running with a copy of Windows 2003 Server running on it, and pretty much open all the time, but one thing i noticed was i didn&#8217;t get anything done. Ok, so my .Mac email account has been read probably more than anything else, my iPod got updated daily (sometimes more than daily) and i played with [Bebo][2] a lot, but no programming was done. I did play with some photos, but, being a programmer, i felt so unproductive. 

So, for the next week (and probably longer) i will hopefully stay on Windows Vista x64 edition for as long as i can. hopefully my productivity will increase, and i can get back to writing proper code&#8230; Lets hope so anyway.
