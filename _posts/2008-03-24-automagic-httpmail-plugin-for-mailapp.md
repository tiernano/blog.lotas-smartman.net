[Automagic software has an addon for mail.app][1] which allows you to get your hotmail email in OSX&#8217;s mail.app. this is cool. i get LOTs of email in my hotmail account, but the interface i dont like. this is sweet. i would like to get my hands on the [Outlook Live][2] thing, but its not available in Ireland and thats where my billing account is now. We see how this works now though&#8230;
