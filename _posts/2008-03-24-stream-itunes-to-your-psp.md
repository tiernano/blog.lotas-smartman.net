Right. I kind of got a PSP a while back, mainly as an exchange from a friend  
who needed a Camera for college (my old Fuji Finepix S7000). So, there was a  
direct swap, and to tell you the truth, i have played around with it for a  
while, but havent done a lot with it. i got some games, but, meh. Anyway, to  
make a long story boring, check out this tutorial on [how to  
stream your iTunes music to your PSP][1]. I dont actually store a lot of music  
in iTunes (mainly use it for PodCasts) but it might be handy to someone&#8230;.  
probably&#8230; [[via Digg][2]]
