Just heard that [Scoble is to leave microsoft][1]. what do you say about that? Well, good luck, first of all, but also, we will miss you. i know your still blogging, but I will miss the interviews you did on Channel 9. Also, in funny related news, Scoble managed to take the PodTech.net site, the company he will be working for, [down for an hour][2]! Thats mad! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Well, good luck Robert, and thanks for all the <strike>fish</strike> videos!
