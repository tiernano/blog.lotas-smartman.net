Long live the new Media Center, when ever I build it. Well, when I say dead, I mean, not completely dead, just technically dead. I have hit a limit on the machine when it comes to Hard Drives and RAM. its got a gig of ram at the moment, and the hdds are maxing out at about 127gb (or what ever the limit is). There was 3 hard drives in the machine (2 120Gbs and an 80Gb) and 2 of them have died in the last 2 weeks! Its an old box (Dual Athlon 2Gz) and I think I will retire it to act as a server of some sort. Its a pity cause I have had this machine for the last 3 years or so&#8230; Good buy old friend&#8230; </p>
