[slashdot are reporting that the][1] [Amazon A9][2] search bar tracks your surfing habbits. i downloaded this when i heard. Why? handy to have. in one way, if this is marketed right and modified even, the ability to search your browser history, from any computer, would be a great benifit! like i have my machine at home and my machine in work and i surf a fair amount on both. now i know in work theres some internal sites that shouldnet be monitored, but A9 should have a fix for that. anyway, the ability to search for pages you have already been to, like on the front page a search web or search history, would make life that much easer! how cool is that? Ok, you have privacy concerns, but if you do, dont install it!
