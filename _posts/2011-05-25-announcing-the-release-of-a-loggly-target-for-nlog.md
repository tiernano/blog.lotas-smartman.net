So, [finished college for the summer on Monday][1], and already have released something!

I heard about [Loggly][2] a while back, and instantly though &#8220;Thats cool&#8221;&#8230; then i seen the price tag and though &#8220;Ouch!&#8221;&#8230; that was when their Smallest paid account (there is a free Dev account with 200mb logging capability per day and log retention for a week&#8230;) was about $99! but today they announced a new [Custom Pricing setup][3]. you tell them how much you want to log per day and how long you want it kept, and pay what their site says&#8230; Very cool stuff&#8230; Pricing now starts at just $8 for storing 200mb per day for 15 days.

Anyway, I also like [NLog][4], an .NET open Logging tool. quite simple and easy to config, and i though, &#8220;wouldn&#8217;tÂ both of these work well together?&#8221; So, today, I am announcing the release of The Loggly Target for NLog. The code [is up on GitHub][5], and you can post issues on the site, and since the code is freely available, make fixes and send them back.
