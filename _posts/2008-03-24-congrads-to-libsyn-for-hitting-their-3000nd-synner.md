I would like to congradulate [Libsyn][1] [for hitting their 3000nd LibSynner][2]! Libsyn host [my PodCast][3], and without them i would probably be screwed! some interesting stats from the post: 55000 episodes, 1million media files served daily, and that works out to 1Tb of data served every 15min! Thats just nuts! that works out at 9.1Gbits a second! Thats cool! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Congrads again!
