Ok. i have been in sligo all weekend, and now im back, i still have a day and a half left to do stuff! just installing [Visual Studio 2005][1] RTM on my machine from the MSDN now, which is cool. Going to install [SQL Server&nbsp;2005][2] too. I got a new hard drive in my workstation (120Gb) and i have managed to use 50Gb even though i wasent here (media center.. need i say more?). So, hopefully tomorrow i will be back to normal operation&#8230; but then again, maybe not&#8230;
