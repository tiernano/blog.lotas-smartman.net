I went looking for some code for a C# FTP client (trying some automation of my own for uploading podcasts, more on that eventually) and i found on the front of [CodeProject][1] a [DNS Compoent for C#][2]. This could be handy for a few things, so i though i would post it here. But back to what i was acutally looking for: an [FTP client library&nbsp;in C#][3]. Very cool stuff. now i hopefully can make my life easer! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
