MSDN magazine has a cool article talking about how to easily [write code for both Windows Mobile and Windows Desktop Applications][1]. This is something i have to look into when continuing building [MobileBlogPoster][2], when ever i get around to that. There may (and its a big maybe) be a version for the desktop, but that&#8217;s only because, hopefully, the Business Logic Layer (the part that does the main posting, etc) can be ported to the Desktop.
