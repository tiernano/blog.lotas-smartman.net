[ZDNet is reporting that][1] US Robotica has managed to get 802.11g wifi networks running at 125mb/s. this puts it in line with standard Cat5 when it comes to speed. And older 802.11g devices can get updates to 125mb/s from its [website][2]. that being said, its probably limited updates. i wonder what the actuall max speed of this is. like standard 802.11G has a real max of about 22mb/s (i think) so does this half in speed too? Still, 62.5mb/s is nice. i wonder&#8230;.
