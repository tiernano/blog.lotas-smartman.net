[this post over at russels notebook][1] talks about how apple have made [OSX][2] like a subscription service. they release a new version every year and loads of people get it, and they use the money to fund development. he thinks its cool and im thinking its cool, but $129 is a bit expencive to upgrade. although for $199 you can get 5 copies for family license. now, if you could buy 5 updates for $199 that would be better (10.3, 10.4,10.5 etc). could be cool. still need a couple of grand for the [G5][3] i want! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
