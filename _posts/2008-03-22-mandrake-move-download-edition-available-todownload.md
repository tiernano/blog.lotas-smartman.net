[MandrakeMove][1], a Bootable CD version of Mandrake, is available to download now. looks pretty cool, but the major flaw is the fact that to use the feature for saving all personal settings, etc to a USB key, you must buy the commercial version. the commercial version comes in a box, and you can buy it without the usb key, with a 128mb key or a 256mb key. theres actually a 512mb key too. the one without the key is 20, the 512mb one is 270, 128mb is 70 and the 256mb option is 129. wonder does [knoppix][2] support this yet. ill try it tomorrow.
