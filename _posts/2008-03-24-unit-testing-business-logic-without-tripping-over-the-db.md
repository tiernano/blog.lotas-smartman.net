Interesting article over at CodeBetter talking about [Unit Testing Business Logic layers][1].

> *Slow tests directly impact the velocity of a development team in a negative manner. When I was first out of college I was doing large engineering calculations on an old 486. Each calculation run could take 5 minutes plus. When we moved up to P5-100’s our productivity jumped significantly. Slow unit tests are like working with 486’s. I do miss napping in my cube though.*

I know exactly what you mean!
