Ok. im lying in bed, half awake half asleep, trying to go back to sleep, and i hear all 3 computers (workstation, win2k3 server and my linux server) beep and rebooting! all at the same time. there is nothing in any of the system logs to explain whats happened. EVEN THE ROTUER REBOOTED!! this is just weird.
