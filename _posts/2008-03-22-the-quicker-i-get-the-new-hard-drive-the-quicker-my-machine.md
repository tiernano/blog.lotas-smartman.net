Right. this is now getting rediculos. i have my dual athlon with a gig of ram and things are as slow as much flowing up a hill. i hit the send and recive mail button in outlook 2002 and it takes 10 min to download 400 emails from my local server on the same machine. while its doing that, web access slows to a crawl and surfing is painfull. luckly i only have to download any where close 400 messages 2x a day (when i get up at 6am theres about 250-300 and when i get back from work, theres about 400 or so). im hopgint its just the hard drive. that means when i get it in about 2 weeks, my computer can be as fast as it wants to be! SWEET.
