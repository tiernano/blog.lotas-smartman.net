According to [this artice][1] sun are planning to make [java 1.4.2][2] easer to use and faster.   
&#8220;*Among other changes, the new version 1.4.2 of Java 2 Standard Edition will include buttons, menu bars, and other graphical elements that match the feel of Windows XP or the [Gnome][3] interface to Linux. Version 1.4.2 also offers a new control panel, an automatic update feature, and a swifter response when taking actions such as displaying a list of files stored on a hard disk.*&#8220;

I actually though java looked pretty cool as standard. i want it to be faster because now im learning java, it would be nice to make it fast too!
