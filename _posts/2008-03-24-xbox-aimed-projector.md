[this PCWord article talks about a new projector designed for the Xbox][1]. its made by a company called Boxlight and its called the Raven. 3000 hours of bulb life, which is 50% more then some other projectors (they say their other products have a 2000 &#8211; 2500 hour bulb life). even if you where to play for 4 hours a night, thats over 2 years of gaming! wonder would it act as a good standard projector for DVDs or a media center&#8230;
