Doug Holland has a post over at the Intel Software Blogs talking about [Virtulization for the Software Engineer][1]. Very interesting read, and its something very important. I love virtualization because it allows you to have a complete development and testing lab on a singe box (hardware permitting). For example, my Mac Pro, with a total of 4 2.66Gz cores and 5 Gb ram can have many different machines running, all running nice and fast without any problems or slow downs. Very cool stuff!
