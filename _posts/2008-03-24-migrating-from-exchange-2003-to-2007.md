<img src="http://images.lotas-smartman.net/image.ashx?id=3d51c4f8-dac1-4f3c-b35e-57dfb749de48" align="right" /> I am a bit of an Odd sort. I am one of very few people I know who run their own mail servers from home, and of them, I am the only one running an [Exchange Server][1] at home. I have been running Exchange 2003 for a good long while now (my mail&nbsp;boxes weigh in at a staggering 4Gb, and I have over 666000 emails in total on the server. because of this, things are getting slow. the machine&nbsp;only has a Hyper threaded&nbsp;Xeon at 2.4Gz&nbsp;and is backed up by about 768mb&nbsp;of RAM. It works, but the machine can sometimes get bogged down (this is the same machine running the web and SQL server for this site. 

So, anyway, I started to think about upgrading to an Exchange 2007 Server. [MSExchange.org has an article showing you what to do][2]. Firstly, I need a new machine to run this on as Exchange 2007 is X64 only. So, we see how things go. More on that later!
