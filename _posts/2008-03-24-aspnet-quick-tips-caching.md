Scott Watermasysk has a post on <a class href="http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/asp-net-caching-tips/">Caching in ASP.NET</a>&nbsp;which is a very interesting and handy read. some interesting tid bits: in Community Server (the software used to host this site) posts are only cached if they are less then 7 days old. any older, and they are not. interesting idea. I will definatly be taking this into account on some new projects (and old ones too). [update] this is a second in a series of posts, the first one on <a class href="http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/asp-net-state-management-tips/">State Managment</a>, which some of you may also find useful! [update 2] this was not part 2, it was part 4! here are the first 2: [General ASP.Net Tips][1]&nbsp;and [Web.config Tips][2]. [update 3] fixed the name of the person who wrote the blog&#8230; Ancora Imparo is the blog name, not a person. Im not awake today! Sorry Scott!
