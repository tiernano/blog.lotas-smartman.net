cool! check out [Atomic Lava][1]. Its an app for your microsoft smartphone 2003 that allows you to post from your phone and you can make multiple posts, and then sync later. this thing is everything i want in a blog posting software! my moblog is at [www.atomiclava.net/lotas][2]. You have to ask for an account and software, so not everyone can just download and run. check it out though! im adding the RSS feed to [RSSAgg][3] now in a minute.
