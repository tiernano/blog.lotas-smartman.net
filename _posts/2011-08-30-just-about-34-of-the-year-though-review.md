Right, so at the start of the year, i wrote a [post on the things i wanted to do this year][1]… Oddly enough, one of them was not blog more, which is something i haven&#8217;t done anyway… That post, which was posted at the start of January was only 6 posts ago! I really need to post more!

Anyway, quick round up of how its going… 

  * **Develop at least one mobile app: **I have started on this, but not released anything. I have a project on [GitHub][2] i have been meaning to finish. I also have a bit of a [sample project with Windows Phone 7 Code][3] i started… I did get enrolled in the Windows Phone Developer program though College, so i just need to “pull my finger out” to get something finished…
  * **Work on my own projects outside of work: **I have done some work outside of “work” work… I have some public projects on [GitHub][4], like the [Loggly][5] Target for NLog (which i [posted about here][6]), [GitPushMSBuild][7], which will (whenever i get around to finishing it) will allow you to do a git push to a repository, which will then kick off an MSBuild, erm, build…&#160; I have some private Repos also, but i could tell you what was in them, but i would have to kill you…
  * **Move the sites outside of the network: Done! **Finally, all my sites are running on a dedicated box in Germany from [Hetzner][8]. Its an [Dedicated EQ4][9] with Quad Core i7, has 8Gb ram, 2 750Gb HDDs in RAID 1, got 100mb/s connection, IPV4/6 connectivity and is running Windows 2008 R2 Web Edition. As a second part of this, i have also started the move of my Exchange Box from In house to [Office365][10]. No more managing of Exchange for me! well, physical machine management anyway!
  * **Use a language other than c# for programming: **Ok, so in College last semester, I wrote code in Java. I also wrote some Java code for work. I am also looking into coding in CUDA though a course from Stanford on GPU programming, which is mostly C++. 
  * **Take more photos: **Right… I have actually taken a few more photos this year than i though… Putting them online is a different story… The last set of photos i posted this year, taken this year, was on [Paddy&#8217;s day of random cars and trucks i seen around][11]. the last one previous to that was from [New York last year][12]…
  * **Finally fix my room and desk once and for all! **Currently in the process of doing this (I swear!) Most of my machines are off, i can see and get to parts of my room i haven&#8217;t been able to get to in years, and i have the desk (mostly) picked out… the [Ikea Vika Amon / Vika Curry][13] seem to be what i want… Now all i need to do is get to finish what i started…

There were some Random things i wanted to try get done also:

  * **Get a new media centre box: **Got a small Media Centre a while back. Don&#8217;t know what its called, but its a Dual core Atom, has about 2Gb RAM, runs Windows 7, has HDMI with audio out and does the job i want it for, which is, currently, play videos using [Boxee][14].&#160; 
  * **Build a SAN: **I have the hardware, just haven&#8217;t finished it… like a lot of my Spare time stuff…
  * **Rip ALL my DVDs and Blu-rays: **The problem with this one is 2 fold: one: i don&#8217;t have a DVD or Blu-ray player in the GodBox, my most powerful machine… i reckon it would encode a DVD or Blu-ray fairly quickly… And second: without the SAN, i am running out of space quickly… So, first is to finish the SAN. then, put a Blu-ray drive in the GodBox and start ripping!

SO, overall, getting there… I will try post a bit more also… Im just a Lazy git… <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wlEmoticon-smile.png" />
