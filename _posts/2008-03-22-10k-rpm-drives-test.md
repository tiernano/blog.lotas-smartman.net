[this tech report article][1] has 3 10k RPM hard drives. 2 SCSI drives and a Serial ATA. They all have 8mb cache, the 2 SCSI offer 147Gb space and the Serial ATA offers 36Gb, and they all have 5 year warrenties. the reason im posting this is becasue they all have a 1.2million hour MTBF (Mean Time Before Failure) which by my calculations works out at about 136 years before failure! (1200000/24 = 50000 / 365 = 136.98 years). now am i wrong?! im thinking thats a good thing!!!
