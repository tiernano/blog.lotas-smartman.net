Right, so, today Apple and EMI have announced that EMIs catalog of what ever many songs EMI have on iTunes, will be [available DRM Free in May][1]. Now, this is a very cool thing. there is some other stuff about the announcement too. firstly, the songs go up by $0.30 per DRM Free song (you can still buy the non DRM Free stuff for 99c) but quality goes up too (from 128kb to 256kb). Interesting. Microsoft has said that [Zune is looking at doing something similar too][2] or at least is in talks. This is something i will watch with interest, and will probably comment more tomorrow.
