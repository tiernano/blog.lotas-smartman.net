Right. just installing windows XP on my machine again. this is becasue [gentoo][1] is getting weird. its nothing to do with the software, its a hard ware problem. my hard drive is getting weird.. windows uses it no problem, but any other os, like linux or qnx or the like, have problems. so just waiting on it to finish installing and i should be good to go. its handy having an other machine to blog with and the imac rocks for it too. wonder is there any blogging software for a mac with os 8.6?
