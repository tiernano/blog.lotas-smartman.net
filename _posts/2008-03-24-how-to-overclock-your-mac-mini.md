I found this page on [how to over clock your mac  
mini][1] though [Engadget][2]. there are  
jumpers on the mac mini, which are really small (photo on the site). you remove  
them, and your grand. well, they tell you the speed info on the site. you get  
get up to 1.58Gz out&nbsp;of it. in the article they clocked their 1.25Gz to  
1.42Gz.
