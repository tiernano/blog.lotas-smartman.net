Right. for some reason the server was down for about 4 hours last night. dont know why, but the apache webserver just dident send any requests. i got about 7 seven text messages, but only the last one woke me. damn nokia 3310 not having a louder ring tone. the 7650 would have woke me! anyway, i fixed the server, and its working now. hope it doesent die again.
