Now this is cool! If you have a MySQL DB, and install the [interface talked about here][1], you can store your MySQL data on Amazon S3. Not completely 100% sure of what in the back end it does, but this rocks! Think about it: you could have a few machines around the web, all using the same back end storage, and it wouldn&#8217;t cost a fortune. Now, if only we could get something that dident involve MySQL (think an Amazon SQL Server&#8230;)
