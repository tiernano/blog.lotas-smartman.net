I ordered a [Palm Bluetooth][1] adapter for my [Handspring Treo 90][2] on Friday and it was shipped on Monday. i ordered the PDA its self on 27th Feb, and it was shipped 2nd March. But the weird thing is my Bluetooth adapter arrived today, and the PDA is still MIA! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> BTW, the Palm Bluetooth adapter will work with the Handspring but you need to upgrade the firmware. check the [Handspring website][3] for more on that! its only 12.40pm now so i might get the PDA by courrier in the next few hours, but it may be tomorrow. im hoping its tomorrow, cuase i want to play with it over the weekend!
