Compressing web pages is a handy way of reducing bandwidth and also making your site faster. Take for example this site. Without compression, it weighs in at about 100k (which is a LOT!) with compression, that drops to 15k. 85% decreese in whats comming down the line to you. which means, my bandwidth should drop, and more people should see my site being faster. hopefully. Well, how do you enable it? Check out [this post over at DotNetJunkies showing you how to do it in IIS6][1]. It has just been enabled on this site, so hopefully all will go well! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
