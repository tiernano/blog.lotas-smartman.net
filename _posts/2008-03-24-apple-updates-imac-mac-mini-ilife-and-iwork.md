So, Apple has updated the [iMac][1], which now looks very nice, has a 2.8Gz dual core proc (Core 2 Extreme), 1Tb hdd and built in wireless, and comes in 20 or 24 inch displays. very lovely looking machine. 

Next, the [Mac Mini][2]. now with Core 2 Proc (64 bit), upto 2Gb ram, 160Gb hdd and GigE networking. pretty much everything else looks the same, except did the old one have 4 USB Sockets? i think it may have only had 3&#8230; Since its now 64bit and capable of taking 2Gb ram, this would become a very nice little server! and with the [hack to add eSATA][3] to it, you could be very sorted!

Both [iLife][4] and [iWork][5] have been bumped to 08 models. currently watching the [guided tour of iLife][6], and haven&#8217;t looked into iWork just yet&#8230; 

Finally, and not least, .Mac gets an upgrade. 10Gb storage (upped from 1Gb), 100Gb bandwidth, upped from 25Gb, and some other stuff. Still not sure what other stuff, as i am only reading this now. Cool stuff though! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
