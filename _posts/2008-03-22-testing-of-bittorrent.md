Ok. as a test of bit torrent for my self, i decided to post both [Sharp Reader (.torrent file)][1]

and [Synderella (.torrent file)][2] as a test. i only have 16k upload speed, and its probably not going to be very fast at all! But as a test. if enough people download, i can use less upload over here. its a test. ill probably kill it soon. but hopefully not. post a comment if you want more!
