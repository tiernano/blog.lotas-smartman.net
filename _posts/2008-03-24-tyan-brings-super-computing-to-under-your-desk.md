Tyan now have a new [super computer for under your desk][1]. Actually, they have 2. [one takes dual core Opterons][2], and can take 8 of them, [the other takes Pentium D processors][3], and can cope with 4 of them. The opterons max out at 64Gb of RAM, whilst the PentiumDs only take 32Gb. Very, very cool stuff! [via [The Inquirer][4]&nbsp;and [Gizmodo][5]]
