Right, been extreamly bust with both Work and non work Life. Its been one of those months&#8230; Dont ask. anyway, here are some random and probably usefull links for you to gnaw on while i try and sort everything out&#8230;

[Calling a web service from PowerShell][1]. Very cool stuff.

[An introduction to Performance Counters (C#)][2]. I think i posted this before, but i now am using it. which brings me on to:

[Updating Performance counters from ASP.NET][3]. You have to do this to get the performance counters to work correctly.

[Asynchronous pages in ASP.NET 2.0][4]. this is cool. I have to use this for something&#8230;

Thats about everything for a while. Hopefully i will get my life back soon&#8230; <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Ohhhh, and i got a [Zune][5]! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
