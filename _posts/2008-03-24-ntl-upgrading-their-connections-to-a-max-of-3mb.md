[the register are reporting that NTL are upgrading their 3 cable packages][1] early next year. The 300k/s connection, which is the minimum at the moment will get an upgrade to 1Mb, their 750k/s gets upgraded to 2mb and their 1.5mb/s connection, which i have now, gets an upgrade to 3mb. no word on weather Ireland will get the upgrade, and no word on upload speed either. now thats sweet! also, no price increese! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> lets hope they get the upgrade to Ireland!
