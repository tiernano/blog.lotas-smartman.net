<a href=\"http://www.mobilegadgetnews.com/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&p=12555#12555\">this page has info on the new Motorola MPx and MPx100\&#8217;s</a> which will be available soon i hope! they both support WLAN (one built in, i think thats the MPx, and the other one has a dedicated accessory) they have loads of memory, SD support, Bluetooth, VoIP (which could make some carriers unhappy and could make others a lot happier) and are powered by Windows mobile edition 2003 SE. Sweet looking phone. 1.3mega pixel camera with support for video at 30FPS. i want!!
