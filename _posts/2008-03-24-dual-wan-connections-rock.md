<p mce_keep="true">About a week ago i got a second internet connection into my Bedroom (third in the house, or 4 if you count the Vodafone HSDPA modem&#8230;). Anyway, Its an 8Mb ADSL2 link with [BT][1]. And this morning i picked up my new Router for the network: the [Linksys/Cisco RV042][2]. Its currently up and running well, and between my 6mb Cable modem and 8mb DSL link i am downloading anywhere from 400k &#8211; 1.1mb/s. Ideally, i should be able to get around 1.7mb/s ([NTL][3]&#8216;s 6Mb is actually 6000k, and the BT line is 8096kb) but due to network conditions, etc, i am not. upload speed should be 1mb/s, but at the moment i havent figured out how to get [ZoneEdit][4] to do balancing on the links, and the RV042 does not talk to ZoneEdit for dynamic dns updates&#8230; So at the moment all web traffic (like this page) is comming from my NTL connection. Eventually, i hope it to be more balanced. </p>
