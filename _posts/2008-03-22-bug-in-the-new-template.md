Ok. theres a bug in the template thats being used on this site. It seems to show in [Opera 7.11][1] on Linux, [Galeon][2] and [Mozilla 1.3.1][3] and [Konqueror][4] all on Linux too. Probably windows and IE is affected. when you visit a induvual page, like this one by clicking the time below, you will see the stats section is not where it is ment to be. ill fix the code in the morning when i have more time. sorry about this bug.
