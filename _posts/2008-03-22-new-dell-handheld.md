[the reg reports][1] that dell are working on an X3 AXIM. This will be the X5 without the CF slot, and will be smaller too. not sure weather it will have a Intel XScale processor or a Samsung S3C2410. Either way, they will be 300 and 400mhz models and the 400 is roumered to have Bluetooth built in! handy. still dont know. X5 or X3?
