[Alex Barnet has a post about google video][1] going live. you can upload any video by going to [the google videos homepage][2], signing up and your good to go. my question: How do i see what others have put up? wheres the search. just a question&#8230; this is cool though. video bloggers may be happy about this one because of google doing their bandwidth and storage for free. i might try this out eventually&#8230;
