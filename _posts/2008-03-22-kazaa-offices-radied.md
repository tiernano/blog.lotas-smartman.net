the offices of Sharman Networks, the makers of [Kazaa][1], [was raided by the Music Industry Piracy Investigations][2]. Execs of several ISPs where raided too. 

*MIPI obtained an Anton Pilar order Ã¢.. which allows a copyright holder to enter a premises to search for and seize material that breaches copyright without alerting the target through court proceedings.*

I just dont understand this! what do they expect to find. like, Sharman Networks made the software so well that it doesent need a central server. like the office of Sharman Networks may as well just be one computer connect to dial up just getting email. that would do the job. this just makes no sense! [update] must remember to put links into postings before posting!
