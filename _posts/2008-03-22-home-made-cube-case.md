[this article shows you][1] how some guy took 2 cases of same size, etc, and stuck them to gether to make a cube. ncie looking case. access to the board, ram, etc looks a little cramped though. but theres enough room for a lot of stuff. this could have been cheaper for me to buy 2 normal case&#8217;s insted of the [monster case][2] i have ATM! (the big black one with the keyboard on it im talking about).
