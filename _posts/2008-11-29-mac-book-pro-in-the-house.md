So, today I finally got my hands on the new Unibody Mac Book Pro. its a 2.4Gz model with 2Gb ram and 250Gb HDD. currently, its dual booting Windows Vista x64 and OSX, and one day I hope to Triple boot with Windows 7 on there too… Anyway, so far so good. Photos of the unboxing are available on my Flickr feed [here][1]. a few things of note, even though I have only had it for a few hours…

  1. Vista on this thing is very nice!&#160; mind you, the trackpad is having problems (even after the software update). seems to be a driver issue, not Vista’s fault. 
  2. The Windows experience score on this thing rocks! [5.3][2]! That’s just crazy! I think my Dual proc, Dual core Mac Pro with desktop graphics got a 5.9, so this being only marginally slower is very crazy… 
  3. the trackpad is HUGE!!! it takes up like a third of the space on the arm rest. very cool though. unfortunately the drivers for Vista (as number one above) are a bit of a let down. the scrolling with 2 fingers works, but the right click is missing and nothing else (like three or 4 finger gestures) work. on OSX, the 3 finger swipe for going back and forward in Safari is very nice… 
  4. Dual monitor display stuff works great on Vista. this mini display port thing is interesting. I have it plugged into my 20
