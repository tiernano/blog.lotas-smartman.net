[this slashdot article][1] talks about [Metronomy][2], a UK based company who are giving 200,000 [IBM PCs away for free][3]. well semi free. you have to watch Advertising. more on the advertising [here][4]. for every hour you use the computer, it shows 3 minutes of ads. now, the question is do you have to be using the computer while it shows ads? i dont like turning computers off since they take too long to start up again. so it would be on for about 8 hours over night and showing about 24min of ads to no one. also i wonder will they offer this to non uk, but close to uk customers (like me in Ireland!).
