I have had a dual processor system for about 10 months now (give or take) and one of the coolest parts about it is if an application decided to run away with a process, most of the time the second processor is left alone allowing me to open task manager and to kill it if needed. I decided to start using <a href=\"http://www.rssbandit.org\">RSS Bandit</a> to read news feeds, and imported <a href=\"http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/\">Scobles</a> OPML feed. he said he reads nearly 1500 blogs a day, and i now do to. that being said, some of the stuff im removing cause its not my cup of tea (cant speak german very well) and im just looking for stuff to read my self. anyway, RSS Bandit takes about 10 min to load while looking for new stuff thats being updated. because i have 2 chips, only one is bogged down with RSS Bandit. handy that!!!
