Today i wouldÂ like to announce the release of [Torrent Helper][1], a website i started coding about 19 hours ago (as of time of writing this post at 6pm on Satrday). The coding of this project started at 11PM on Friday, and took a short break at 6am for some sleep&#8230; It was officially released (with a pop up on Twitter) at [5.29pm][2]&#8230;

Anyway, what does it do? You give it a Torrent file (Legal of course), either the URL or an existing torrent you have somewhere, and it will find extra trackers for that given torrent, add them to the file and send it back to you&#8230; Thats pretty much it!

Any questions, drop me a mail (tierno [at] lotas-smartman [dot] net) or leave a comment.
