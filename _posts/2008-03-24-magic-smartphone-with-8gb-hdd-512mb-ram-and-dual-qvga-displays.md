Check out this [MAGIC smartphone that Engadget has info about][1]. it has an 8Gb hdd, 512mb ram, dual QVGA displays (its like the older nokia communicator, but why not have VGA on the inside display?), Wifi, bluetooth, dual 2 megapixel cameras, QWERTY keyboard, GPS,&nbsp; EDGE,&nbsp;VGA output, and a microSD slot. this is quite big, by the looks of things, and no info on if its WM5 Smartphone or Pocket PC, or what kind of processor it has either. it does run Windows mobile (guessing 5) and it will cost about $1000, which is HTC Universal money (ish). Sweet!
