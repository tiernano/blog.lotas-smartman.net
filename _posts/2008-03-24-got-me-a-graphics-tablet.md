So, i just bought a graphics tablet, and it is pretty sweet! Its got an active pen with it (active meaning i dont actually have to tap the pad for it to move around the screen, much like the tablet pc pens) and it also comes with a mouse with out a ball or an optical eye on it! its much like the pen! its weird! both are wireless, and both take a AAA battery. it connects via USB and thats all i need. a single USB connection. So, im now thinking of installing Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005 (original copy of XP Tablet PC with SP2 becomes TPC 2005) and see what it can do, and what i can do with it. should be fun. photos tomorrow, if i have time, or some time over the weekend.
