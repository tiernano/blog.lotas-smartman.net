because 2 of my servers have died over the last 3 months, i have one large Dell PowerEdge now running my network. the problem is, becasue this is the domain controler and the exchange server, the system takes about 20min to reboot. Well, hopefully this will solve the problem. [MSExchange.org has an article on how to solve this problem][1]. Very cool!
