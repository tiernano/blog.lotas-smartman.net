So, being today being Valentines day (and yesterday being Friday 13th) this aint a good weekend&#8230; The daddy "borrowed" my car to bring the mammy out for a meal (awwww), so i was left with his, which is also a 2.5l BMW 5 series, but his is 4 years older than mine and has a manual gear box&#8230;. and something wrong with the powerstearing pump&#8230; Anyway, drove down to get pizza so i can sit back and watch TV with pizza (yep, single&#8230;) and while on the way home, his iPod (which has the Rolling Stones top 500 songs of all time on it) started to play AC/DC, Highway to hell&#8230; Neadless to say, its the kind fo song that makes you want to put your foot down a bit&#8230; which i did&#8230; had to pull up to a traffic lights, just as the chorus kicks in (i had my window open, by the way, and the volume up fairly loud) and well, car pulls up beside me, with quite a cute looking lady driving (well, it was dark, maybe she was cute&#8230;) and all i could do was laugh, hit the window close button (he window was open too!!!), lower the music and floor it when the light went green&#8230; it was definatly a "you had to be there" moment&#8230; Sorry for my random saturday night/Valentines day rant&#8230; nomral programming will return eventually&#8230;
