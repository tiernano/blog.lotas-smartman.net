If you have a MPX200 and your not happy with being stuck with Windows Moble 2002, check out [this MSMobiles article][1]. it shows you how to get a german copy of windows mobile 2003 on to your MPX200. and [this article][2] helps you get it running 2003 in English. sweet. concidering the MPX200 is now selling for about 300EURO on [Expansys][3] and cheaper if you buy it with a SDIO Camera (dont know why!) its not bad. only thing is the lack of Bluetooth. i still prefer my smartphone though, but for others, this could be cool&#8230;
