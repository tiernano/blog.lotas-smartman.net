[this article over at the MIT Technology Review][1] has some sugestions about an act that should be put into place: the Pure Software Act 2006. In 1906, food makers had to put labels on their produce telling consumers what was in them. The new act, thats being proposed, will tell consumers whats in the software they are buying or installing. Interesting idea.
