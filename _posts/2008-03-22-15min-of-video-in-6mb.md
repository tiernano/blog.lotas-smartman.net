<a href=\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1007246.html\">Russell Beattie got his hands on</a> a Nokia <a href=\"http://www.nokia.com/cda1/0,,54665,00.html\">7610</a>. Its a pretty mad looking phone, but it can record 15min of video in 6mb! thats the memory of the phone. he also notes that you can save it to the 64mb memory card that comes with the phone and store up to 2 hours at a better quality! now that is cool! check out the post. the video quality is not great, but for 6mb, its quite cool!
