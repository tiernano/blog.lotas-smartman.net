I use Visual Studio.net 2003 a lot and one thing im missing is middle click window closing. you know the way you have 4 or 5 different code tabs open and you opened too many and you want to close some. middle click closing would be so handy! i need it in <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org\">mozilla</a> and <a href=\"http://www.opera.com\">Opera</a>, and thats probably why i miss it so much, so, if any MS Developers who work on Visual Studio read this blog, how about adding this?
