toms hardware are asking [are 3 cores better then 2][1]? In theory, yes, but in reality, no. interesting way of testing it: Get a mobo that takes 2 opteron processors, put in a dual core and a single core proc in, and hope for the best! not something i will be doing, mind you. i just want to throw 2 dual core procs into one of those mobos! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
