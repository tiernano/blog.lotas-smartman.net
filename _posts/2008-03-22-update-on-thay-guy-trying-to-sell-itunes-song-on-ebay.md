on wensday, i posted [this post][1] about a [Man][2] who was trying to sell a song he bought off [Apple Itunes][3] for 99c. bidding actually maxed out at $100,000 according to [this register article][4], but it has been pulled from ebay. Ebay say that it was violating their [Downloadable media policy][5]. Hmmmm. still funny!
