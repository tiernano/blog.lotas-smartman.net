Been a geek, programmer, and gadget freak, i decided to write an app for watching my bluetooth GPS device and working out max speed, distance travled, total time, average speed, etc, for when im driving my car. Well, after some magic maths, which dident work out very well, i found t[his page over at ZipCodeWorld with some C# code which allow you to work out a distance between 2 coordanites][1]. Very cool stuff. Works well too. now to do some hacking and make a Pocket PC client for monitoring info in the car&#8230;
