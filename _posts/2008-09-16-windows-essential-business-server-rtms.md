Congradulations to the [Windows Essential Business Server][1] team for [hitting RTM!][2] Essential Business Server, for thouse of you who dont know, if a step up from Small Business Server. this is for companies who have more than one server and allows you to run, say, Exchange on one box and Sharepoint on another. Congradulations again! i know i dont always post congrads when teams hit RTM, but when i do hear about them i do think about congradulating the team.
