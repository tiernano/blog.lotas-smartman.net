Right. im thinking of making a local CVS Server that will sync with [Sourceforge][1] every once in a while. the reason? well, i want to be able to make stuff quicker, send stuff quicker, and if i can connect to my local server without ssh, then i should be able to use most windows development tools easer. i had problems getting [wincvs][2] talking to SF.net. weird. anyway, ill try make the local one. it probably wont be public. any files i put on to it should be on SF.net after a few hours. probably write a script for updating every 3 hours or so. if i can find me an other source versioning system, it could be even cooler, especially if it will update to CVS.
