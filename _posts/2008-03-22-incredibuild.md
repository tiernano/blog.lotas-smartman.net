[FAST C Compilation &#8211; IncrediBuild by Xoreax Software][1]: this sounds cool. Its like [distcc][2], which i talked about a few times, but for windows and not free, and has some gui stuff that looks impressive. well, in an other way i supose its like [Xcode][3] on the mac. Xcode has a distributed build feature which gets other machines to build parts of your code and send the built file back to the main machine for linking, just like distCC does. and im assuming incredibuild does the same but on windows and uses visual C++ and Visual Studio. ill probably try this out. dont do a lot of C++ complation, but ill find something to do with it!
