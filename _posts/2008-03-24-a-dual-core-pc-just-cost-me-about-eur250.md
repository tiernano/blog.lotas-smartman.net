Ok, admitingly, its not for me firstly, and secondly, there are a few components we already have, but the base machine (Processor, RAM and Mobo) costs about EUR250, including VAT and shipping! the board aint top end (<a class href="https://www.komplett.ie/k/ki.asp?sku=329792">ABIT IP-95</a>) but it only cost 60 quid. There is a <a class href="https://www.komplett.ie/k/ki.asp?sku=309926">dual core Pentium D</a> (ok, old is chip, but still nice for the price of 85 quid) and a couple of 512mb sticks of ram too. total price is 248 including vat and shipping. Not bad. me things for another 200 quid, a full box, with case and hdds, could be gotten. Twould be a nice little server too! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
