Ok. the final thing i have done to the news feeds is remove all links form the feed its self, and just have the text. if you want to find the link, just go to the page of that article. for example, in [RSSBandit][1] double clicking on a feed item will bring you to the article page. some will have the title of the article as a link, others may have a &#8220;read on&#8221; link somewhere. if anyone has any problems with this, please leave a comment.
