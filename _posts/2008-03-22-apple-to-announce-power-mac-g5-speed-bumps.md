[Think Secret &#8211; Apple to announce Power Mac G5 speed bumps][1]. dual 2.5Gz will be the top end, and they will start with a single processor 1.8Gz. ohhh and 30inch cinema displays! SWEET. not sure if its soon as in before the WDC or at the WDC, but the WDC is soon (end of month i think). Ohhhh! and a quad processor system is being talked about! wonder would that be a 2 or 3 u G5 Xserve or a deskside server? it wouldent be a workstation, would it?
