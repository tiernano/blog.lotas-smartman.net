Ok, my home cinema is not complete. i need more cables (which just sound wrong when you see the amount of cables currently in use) and also a complete room re-org. The bed has to be moved, speakers have to be mounted on walls, the TV has to move, cables have to be rearanged properly and above all, tested with a good DVD. Maybe next week&#8230; Photos are available to view [here][1]
