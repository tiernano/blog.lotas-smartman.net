At last! the server is now up and running. i have my eye on it at the moment, and it seems stable. I will be adding new sites in the next few days now, and hopefully everything will go well. the server is an AMD Duron 700Mhz with 384mb ram and a 30Gb hard drive. its currently running windows server 2003 with IIS6 and PHP 4.3.10. I am about to install the .NET framework 2.0 for testing and same with SQL Server 2005 Express. these will be used for some of my new sites in the next few weeks.
