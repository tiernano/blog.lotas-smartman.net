[the register are reporting][1] that sharp will be releasing a new PDA, called the Zaurus SL-C3000, which will include a 416Mhz Intel XScale PXA270, which is the same one as is in my Axim x30, but slightly slower, it also has 64Mb SDRAM, 16Mb ROM and a 4Gb hard drive! No Wifi or Bluetooth, only IR, but includes SD and CF. Keyboard, touch screen and foldy clam shell thingy design. looks pretty sweet. runs linux, which im not going to say anything about. after playing with win2k3 mobile edition, i dont want to play with anything else for a while! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
