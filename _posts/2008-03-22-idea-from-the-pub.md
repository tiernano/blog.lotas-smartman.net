Ok. this idea came around becasue this monday is a bank holiday in Ireland and neither me, nor Mr Burleigh (Electromagiction) or Mr Kelly (Student who lives in Sligo, but really from Dublin) are in work or college tommorow and we decided to go to the pub. after a few pints of the black stuff ([Guinness to non Irish readers][1]) we came up with the idea that studyin is a form of cheating. this is because you have an unfair advantage over people who havent studied. it may be their fault for not studying but its still an unfair advantage!!! is it not?
