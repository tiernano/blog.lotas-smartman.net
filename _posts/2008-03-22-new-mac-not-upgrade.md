Right. i was thinking of getting an upgrade for my current iMac to bring it up to a 466Mhz G4, but i started thinking. if i did this, and spent what i was going to spend on the machine, where do i go then? Whats next? and i worked it out that after a processor upgrade, ram and hard drive, theres nothing else. so, an emac looks nice now! i was looking at them on the apple site [here][1] and they look pretty sweet. i was looking at it and i think the 1Gz model with the combo drive and 40gb hdd will do me. i have an 80gb here which is in my imac at the moment so that will go into the emac, if i get it. also ram wise, ill probably go with the 128mb in the machine and buy extra later. or even start with 256. i think it takes standard ram? correct me if im wrong there (please!). anyway, ramblings at the moment. wont be for a while, but i can dream&#8230;
