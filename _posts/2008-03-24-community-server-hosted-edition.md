[Community Server][1] is now available in a [Hosted Edition][2]. Only problem: Price. $49 a month for 5 blogs and some other things. When i heard that this was live, i though &#8220;cool! this will let me host my blog externally on CS, and not have to worry about it&#8221;. then i seen the price. Now, if this was cheaper ($7.50 a month&nbsp;for 1 blog, and leave the extras like the Forums/Files/Photos sections out, same kind of bandwidth (15Gb) and some sort of AntiSpam stuff) I would be buying it now. But $49 for 5 blogs (which i will only use 1 of) and Forums (which i probably wont use at all) and the rest, is just mad. I already host it at home, so support for migrating from a local copy would be good too&#8230;
