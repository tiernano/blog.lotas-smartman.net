[Game PC has this test][1] of the Opteron 248 vs. Xeon 3.2A / 1MB. nice read. lots of info, pics, and bechmarks. one thing i dident like. they only tested windows. i would like to see some linux tests, mainly because the opteron being 64bit, and windows xp 64bit edition still being in beta, or what ever it is, would not preform as well as a fully 64bit OS. also, the fact that there isent a lot of 64bit apps makes the operon seem slower. that being said, it did give the xeon a good run for its money! actually, it beat the xeon in a lot of tests!
