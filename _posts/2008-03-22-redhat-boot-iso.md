Its about time if you ask me! [Redhat][1] has

finally released a Boot ISO for [Redhat][1] 9 install over the internet. its

3.6mb and has all the stuff you need to install

</p> 

Redhat 9</a> on your machine. This makes things so much easer for me. I now

don&#8217;t have to look for floppies when I need to install a copy of Linux

somewhere. my mother wants it on her PC. I&#8217;m going to burn the ISO (Avaible</p> 

here</a>, but check the</p> 

mirrors</a>). I&#8217;m going to burn it to a CDRW now so i can format the disk after!

Wahoo! I love CDRWs! I will be getting one with

[my Laptop][2]

when i get it!
