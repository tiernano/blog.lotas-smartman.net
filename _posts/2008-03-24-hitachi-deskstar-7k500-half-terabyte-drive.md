[Gizmodo has info about a new drive from Hitachi][1] which is 500Gb in size. SWEET. available in either Serial ATA II (which needs a special controler, but the drive has 16mb cache) for $520 or as a standard ATA drive with 8mb cache for about $500. so, without modification you can now have 2Tb of space in a single machine, and with, god only knows how much you can have! wonder when these will make it into an [XServe][2] or [XServe Raid][3]. that would 1.5Tb in the XServe and 7Tb in the XServe raid. Hmmmm.
