[Mac news network][1] have [this first look][2] and [part 2][3] at [Office 2004][4] for the mac. looks pretty cool. i have Office.X for the mac now. its usable on a G3 333Mhz, but slow in some things. cant wait for the upgrade. getting the hard drive on Saturday and new processor and ram over the next few months (probably processor first, then RAM). anyway, not only that, Microsoft have [announced][5] [Virtual PC for the Mac, Version 7][6], which will come with G5 Support in it. no info on their site, so not sure what it supports or emulates yet.
