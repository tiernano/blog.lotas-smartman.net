Ok. I posted a few months back ([June 10th to be correct][1]) about how to run Windows XP Tablet PC Edition on a standard laptop. and a few days ago i [posted about getting a graphics tablet with active pen][2]. and now, [just a few minutes ago, or so][3] i posted my first post on a tablet pc! Well, a virtual one. Its my Dell Inspiron 510M (Centrino chipset, Pentium M 1.5Gz, 768mb ram, 30Gb hdd, CDRW, etc) with the graphics tablet and a copy of Windows XP Tablet PC Edition on it. thats it! currently installing XPSP2 to get the new Tablet PC 2005 features that come with XPSP2. more info later. Also, i have a load of photos to post from the holidays. i got to play with a [Orange SPV500][4] which is a really sweet looking phone. photos of that. so more later as i said. watch this space&#8230;
