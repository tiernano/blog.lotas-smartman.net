[the register are reporting][1] that the specs of the Nintendo DS, the dual screen gaming device [that i talked about here][2] will have, as i said, 2 processors: one is an ARM9 at 67Mhz, the other an ARM7 running @ 33Mhz. it will have Dual screen, touch panel input device, Wireless lan and 3D Graphics. 4mb of ram, or if your luckey enough to get your hands on a debug development version you can have 8mb. sounds like a nice device. more info on the first link above.
