Hmmm. Ok i got a letter on Monday saying that NTL ireland are discontinuing their phone service. [More info here][1]. I was on NTL&#8217;s Landline service. I had it for a few years and now i have to move to [Eircom][2]. not to happy with that to tell you the&nbsp;truth.&nbsp;Well, now it means i can get both&nbsp;Cable modem AND ADSL! so, the site might get more bandwidth eventually! Anyway, more about that later. [update] i forgot to mention, this only effects phone services from NTL. their Cable modem, TV and anything else (Actually, thats all they have!) is not effected.
