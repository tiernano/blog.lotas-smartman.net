The guys over at [HardOCP][1] have managed to fry a 1Gz athlon, a 2Gz P4, [A 3Gz][2] P4 (while cooled to -25C and also running at 4.2Gz!) and now they are cooling a 3gz P4 to run at [4.44Gz in this article.][3] Quite interesting. Twin [Vapochills][4] and water cooling all in one case. sounds like fun!
