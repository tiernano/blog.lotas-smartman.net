I posted last night that i needed to format and reinstall my system. well i found out this morning that i dont. when the system rebooted this morning, it asked did i want to send a report to microsoft. since this is the 4th this has happened (could be 5th, dont know) i decided to say yes and see what it would tell me, if anything. it brought me to a page saying that &#8220;a device driver is causing the problems&#8221;. so, i checked the hard ware manager and to my suprise, the video adapter in my system was just a normal one. it was not using the NVidia drivers. strange thing is though that i downloaded them off the windows update site, so i though it installed them and got them working. Anyway, im downloading the drivers from NVidias site now so hopefully that fixes the problem!
