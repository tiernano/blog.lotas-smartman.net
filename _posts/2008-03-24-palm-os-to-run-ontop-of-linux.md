[Engadget are reporting that Palm OS will eventually run on top of Linux][1]. Now, they are not releasing their code Open Source, but their GUI will run on top of, most likly, a custom build of Linux. i would make a guess that it is kind of like what Apple did when they started using BSD as their kernel and their GUI as the rest, but with palmtops.
