[Windows Powershell][1] is probably one of the coolest things i have seen in a while (except for, maybe, my new air cooler in my room! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> sorry, i had to do that..). but anyway. the things you can get this to do is just amazing. while reading Scott Hanselman&#8217;s blog, ComputerZen.com, i found the following articles and links:  
[Searching google desktop from Power Shell][2]  
Searching Windows Desktop search using Power Shell</a>  
[using FFMPEG to squish lots of videos using power shell][3] which is not as unusefull as he sugests, as it might be handy for me to use to copy a lot of recorded TV from my MCE for my PSP&#8230;   
[Testing powershell scripts using NUnit][4] which is handy  
and finally, and probably one of the handyest:   
[Powershell, AnknSVN and Subversion][5]. very handy!   
Scott even has a podcast episode on the subject [here][6]. extreamly cool stuff!
