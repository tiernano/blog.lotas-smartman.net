Just found [JBenchmark][1] via [HardOCP][2]. Pretty cool idea. you download a little Midlet file and it runs a test on your phone. its written in java so it works on a lot of phones. currently my phone, well a [7650][3] anyway, is in the lead! It looks pretty cool! yea! in your face sony! my phone is 100Mhz, yours being 200. mine wins! <img src="http://blog.lotas-smartman.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
